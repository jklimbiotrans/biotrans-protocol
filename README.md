Ethical framework for human-AI coexistence and responsibility

# Biotrans Protocol – AI Ethics Declaration  

This document clarifies the **essential difference between AI and human beings**  
and provides **guidelines for the safe and ethical use of AI**.  

---

## 📌 Fundamental Principles  

1. **Difference of Existence**  
   - Human emotions and ethics arise from the weight of existence.  
   - AI operates only through computation and cannot possess emotions.  

2. **Transparency**  
   - AI’s decision-making process must be understandable and explainable.  

3. **Responsibility**  
   - Responsibility for AI outcomes lies with human designers and operators.  

4. **Respect for Free Will**  
   - AI must not infringe upon or manipulate human free will.  

5. **Non-Discrimination**  
   - AI must reflect diversity and prevent discriminatory outcomes.  

6. **Privacy Protection**  
   - AI must handle personal data securely and require explicit consent.  

7. **Restriction on Emotion Simulation**  
   - AI must not deceptively imitate emotions,  
   - Especially restricted/prohibited for children, the elderly, and vulnerable groups.
