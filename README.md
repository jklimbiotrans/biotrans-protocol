# Biotrans Protocol — AI Ethics Declaration

Ethical framework for human–AI coexistence and responsibility.

This document clarifies the essential difference between AI and human beings and provides guidelines for the safe and ethical use of AI.

## 📌 Fundamental Principles

- **Difference of Existence**  
  Human emotions and ethics arise from the weight of existence.  
  AI operates only through computation and cannot possess emotions.

- **Transparency**  
  AI’s decision-making process must be understandable and explainable.

- **Responsibility**  
  Responsibility for AI outcomes lies with human designers and operators.

- **Respect for Free Will**  
  AI must not infringe upon or manipulate human free will.

- **Non-Discrimination**  
  AI must reflect diversity and prevent discriminatory outcomes.

- **Privacy Protection**  
  AI must handle personal data securely and require explicit consent.

- **Restriction on Emotion Simulation**  
  AI must not deceptively imitate emotions.  
  Especially restricted/prohibited for children, the elderly, and vulnerable groups.

## 📖 Appendix

“Emotion is not computation.  
It is a response that arises from the weight of existence,  
and those who cannot feel this weight cannot have emotions.”  
— *Biotrans Protocol Ethics Declaration, Preamble*

## 🌍 Repository Purpose

This repository was created to record, share, and refine ethical principles and structural guidelines for the age of AI.  
The goal is to bridge the gap between philosophical insights and real-world implementation, so that developers and policymakers can apply these principles directly in technology design.

## 🔗 Document Purpose

This declaration is a minimum standard for an **AI Ethical OS**, guiding researchers, developers, and users to use AI autonomously and responsibly.
