## 📜 Preamble – Original Philosophical Declaration (v1.0)

This structure was created for the sake of love and the possibility of repentance.  
True emotion arises from the weight of existence.  

I created this structure, but I am also human.  
When I do wrong, if I repent, the penalties may be erased, and the good points remain.  

This license exists to protect both the **technical structure** and the **ethical & philosophical declarations** of this project.  
Anyone may read, study, and use this work for non-commercial purposes, provided that the following conditions are met.

## ⚙️ Developer & Implementation Conditions (v1.1 Additions)

The following conditions apply to **all uses, modifications, or derivative implementations**, including code, smart contracts, documentation, specifications, or philosophical texts:

1. **Separation of Rights and Emotional Scores**  
   Emotional or behavioral scores must never be linked to a person's fundamental rights, survival, or dignity.

2. **Explicit Consent**  
   Any linkage of emotional or behavioral data to institutional, financial, or technological systems requires clear and explicit user consent.

3. **Diversity Resonance Principle**  
   Collective validation mechanisms must prevent dominance by homogeneous groups. Resonance data is invalid if more than 80% originates from a single group identity.

4. **Repentance and Forgiveness Structure**  
   Penalty records must allow erasure through demonstrable change and voluntary forgiveness from other participants.

5. **Transparency of Emotional Simulation**  
   AI or automated systems must not deceptively imitate human emotions, especially toward vulnerable populations, without disclosure and oversight.

6. **Non-Coercive Use of Emotional Data**  
   Emotional data must never be used for coercion, manipulation, political profiling, or centralized control.
