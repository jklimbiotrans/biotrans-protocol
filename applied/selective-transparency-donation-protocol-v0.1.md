# Selective Transparency Donation Protocol v0.1
### SBT-Based Selective Transparency Donation System (Biotrans Draft)

---

## 1. Purpose
This protocol proposes an experimental model for donation, funding, and political contribution systems that enables  
**“Selective Proof” instead of “Total Exposure.”**  

The aim is to digitize the moral and emotional trust structure — **conscience, empathy, and autonomy** — that exists before any legal or institutional framework.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy
- **Transparency ≠ Exposure**  
  True transparency is not about revealing everything but about building a structure that allows *truth to be proven when necessary*.
- **Autonomy over Disclosure**  
  Individuals can selectively disclose what they wish to make public.  
  Unrevealed information remains *verifiable* in a secure state.
- **Ethical Neutrality**  
  This system represents no political faction — only ethics, trust, and contribution are measured.

---

## 3. Key Concepts

### 3.1. SBT (Soul-Bound Token)
- A **non-transferable token** representing ethical trust.  
- It connects a donor’s identity, contribution record, and attestation signatures, but cannot be traded.  
- The SBT serves as a **trust fingerprint**, recording *intent and transparency* rather than monetary value.

---

## 4. Design Overview

### 4.1. Data Layer
- **On-Chain**: Timestamp, hash, and signature (immutable).  
- **Off-Chain (IPFS, Arweave, etc.)**: Actual donation details encrypted and stored separately.  
- **Selective Key Disclosure**: Donors can choose which data fields to reveal.

| Field | Disclosure | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Amount | Optional | Can be disclosed at will |
| Category | Always Public | e.g., Education, Environment, Public Good |
| Message | Optional | Personal message, can remain private |
| Identity | Optional | Anonymous DID representation possible |

### 4.2. Anonymous Attestation
Users can receive their SBT through an **anonymous DID**.  
The fact that *someone donated* is public, but **who** remains hidden via zero-knowledge proof (ZKP).  
→ *Trust remains without exposure.*

### 4.3. Disclosure Levels (3 Options)
| Level | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| 0 | Fully Private (Hash Only) | Personal donation, privacy-focused |
| 1 | Partially Public (Category + Intent) | “Environmental support” |
| 2 | Fully Public (Amount + Message + Donor Name) | NGO campaign, cooperative transparency |

---

## 5. Process Flow
1. **Donor Creation**  
   - Generate DID → Optional KYC  
2. **Donation Execution**  
   - Send contribution → Record hash + Issue SBT  
3. **Disclosure Selection**  
   - Choose among Level 0–2  
4. **Attestation (Verification)**  
   - NGO, media, or authority adds attestation signature to SBT  
5. **Selective Disclosure**  
   - Donor can reveal off-chain data when desired  
6. **Public Quorum Review**  
   - When a public objection arises, a quorum of verifiers can request validation

---

## 6. Technical Minimalism
This protocol works **without complex governance or legal scaffolding**.  
- *Trust without bureaucracy*  
- *Ethics before logic*  
- *Proof without exposure*  

The smart contract merely serves as a **record of proof**.  
A conceptual design is sufficient; the full source code is not necessary.

---

## 7. Use Cases
- NGO or civic fund transparency  
- Political donation visibility  
- Artist or creator fan contributions  
- Ethical DAO contribution records  
- Blockchain-based public transparency and ESG projects

---

## 8. Ethical Note
This protocol is not a technology for surveillance — it is a technology for **inspiration and restoration**.  
All records serve as tools for *repentance and rebuilding trust*, not punishment.  
Thus, an SBT is not a “penalty mark,” but a **trace of sincerity**.

## 9. License
MIT License  
All applications must include the **Ethical Use Clause**:

> “This system must be used for transparency, trust, and reconciliation.  
> It shall never be used for surveillance, defamation, or infringement of human dignity.”

## 10. Analytical Overview — Reality × Creativity Matrix

This protocol is designed not as a theoretical idea but as a *realizable ethical infrastructure*.  
It balances **technical feasibility (Reality)** with **conceptual innovation (Creativity)**.

| Axis | Description | Example / Source | Impact |
|------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| **Reality** | Based on existing technologies such as **SBT, DID, Attestation, ZKP, and IPFS/Arweave**. | Ethereum Foundation, Optimism, Ceramic Network, MIT DCI. | Enables practical implementation and verifiable trust. |
| **Creativity** | Introduces **conscience, repentance, empathy, and voluntary transparency** as design primitives. | Biotrans Ethics OS philosophy. | Expands blockchain from “transactional proof” to “moral proof.” |
| **Ethical Design Shift** | Reframes *transparency* as “forgivable verification” rather than exposure. | Human-centered ethical logic. | Makes technology emotionally sustainable and socially acceptable. |
| **Practical Outcome** | Prototype-ready with minimal governance and open auditing. | Applied within the Biotrans ecosystem. | Bridges blockchain accountability with moral legitimacy. |

### Summary
This balance produces a **Human-Centered Technical Structure** —  
> “A philosophical document that engineers can build,  
> and a technical document that philosophers can understand.”

Such equilibrium ensures that Biotrans Protocol remains both *implementable* and *inspirational*,  
functioning as a real-world blueprint for ethical digital transformation.
