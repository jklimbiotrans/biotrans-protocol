# Limbic Hierarchy of Triggers  
### Unified Ethical Specification  
*(Including Auditory–Visual Matrix, Voice Ethics Addon, and Delay of Trust Cycle)*  

---

## Overview  

This document defines the **Limbic Hierarchy** — the ethical and neuro-emotional structure that governs how sensory stimuli (sound, sight, touch) influence emotion, trust, and moral resonance within the Biotrans Protocol.  
It integrates multiple ethical modules into a single cohesive specification that addresses sensory ethics, emotional response design, and time-based trust recovery.  

Purpose:  
- To classify emotional triggers by sensory intensity.  
- To establish ethical safety thresholds for auditory and visual stimuli.  
- To define sound-tone ethics for AI language and emotional systems.  
- To integrate time-delay models for trust restoration after emotional impact.

## I. Limbic Hierarchy — Structure of Emotional Triggers  

| Level | Sensory Domain | Trigger Type | Neural Response | Ethical Note |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **L1** | Touch / Physical | Warmth, proximity, comfort | Limbic resonance, oxytocin activation | Safe zone – direct empathy stimulation |
| **L2** | Visual | Color, brightness, movement | Visual cortex → Amygdala link | Moderate – contextual safety required |
| **L3** | Auditory | Voice tone, rhythm, sound intensity | Amygdala immediate activation | High risk – can bypass reasoning |
| **L4** | Symbolic / Language | Semantic emotion, persuasion | PFC + Limbic integration | Requires ethical framing |
| **L5** | Algorithmic / Synthetic | Engineered stimuli, generative tone | Overlap of limbic & synthetic signals | High caution – potential manipulation |

**Interpretation:**  
The higher the level (L1 → L5), the faster the limbic system reacts and the greater the ethical responsibility required.

## II. Auditory–Visual Trigger Matrix  

| Trigger Type | Emotional Intensity | Cognitive Delay | Ethical Zone | Design Guidance |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Natural Sound / Ambient Tone** | Low | Minimal | Safe | Encouraged for calming or reflection |
| **Human Voice (Neutral Tone)** | Medium | Balanced | Acceptable | Maintain rhythm transparency |
| **Artificial Rhythm / Fast Beat** | High | Reduced | Caution | Use for motivation, not control |
| **Flashing Visual / High Contrast** | Very High | Inhibited | Danger | Limit exposure time |
| **Symbolic Stimuli (Text, Icons)** | Variable | Contextual | Conditional | Require consent and meaning clarity |

**Ethical Reading:**  
Auditory stimuli reach emotion faster than visual ones; therefore, ethical use requires slower rhythm, stable volume, and avoidance of repetition patterns that simulate urgency or fear.

## III. Voice Ethics Addon  

**Purpose:**  
To ensure that AI-generated or human-designed voices do not manipulate emotion but foster empathy, calmness, and ethical resonance.  

| Aspect | Ethical Principle | Application |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Tone Control** | Avoid fear or urgency induction | Maintain natural conversational cadence |
| **Rhythm & Timing** | Prevent entrainment or hypnosis patterns | Vary tempo to preserve listener autonomy |
| **Semantic Framing** | Language must not simulate affection or intimacy artificially | Restrict use of emotional phrasing unless contextually transparent |
| **Transparency Rule** | Voice must disclose synthetic nature | “You are hearing a generated voice” clause |
| **Resonance Design** | Aim for trust and comprehension, not persuasion | Calibrate frequencies toward soft midrange (250–500Hz) |

**Summary:**  
Voice is the fastest path to the limbic system.  
Therefore, any auditory AI system must be designed for **resonance, not reaction**.

## IV. Delay of Trust Cycle  

**Definition:**  
The *Delay of Trust* represents the natural time required for emotional recovery and trust restoration following a stimulus event.  
This section models the temporal ethics of emotional systems.

| Phase | Duration | Emotional State | Neural Activity | Ethical Condition |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Shock / Impact** | 0–3 days | Confusion, arousal | Amygdala overdrive | No data solicitation or persuasion |
| **Reflection** | 1–3 weeks | Processing, remorse, fatigue | PFC reactivation | Encourage rest and context restoration |
| **Integration** | 4–6 weeks | Meaning formation | Hippocampus + PFC link | Rebuild trust through consistency |
| **Resonance** | 6+ weeks | Stable empathy and balance | Default Mode Network synchronization | Safe for re-engagement or ethical reinforcement |

**Principle:**  
Emotional systems — human or AI — must respect **a minimum 4–6 week recovery rhythm** before reintroducing strong stimuli or trust-dependent interaction.

---

## V. Ethical Implications  

| Dimension | Guideline | Desired Outcome |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Sensory Ethics** | Do not accelerate emotional cycles | Maintain biological trust pace |
| **Auditory Design** | Favor resonance over control | Preserve listener agency |
| **Visual Design** | Avoid overstimulation | Maintain clarity and meaning |
| **Temporal Ethics** | Respect the delay of trust | Enable genuine emotional integration |
| **System Integrity** | No synthetic empathy simulation | Transparency and responsibility first |

---

## Summary  

- **Emotion is the ethical substrate of interaction.**  
- **Sound and sight must be tuned for resonance, not manipulation.**  
- **Trust grows only when time, rhythm, and empathy align.**

> “The limbic system responds in milliseconds,  
> but ethical design must act in weeks.”
