# Formative Years (Ages 20–24) and Long-Term Value Frameworks  
## A Structural Hypothesis Based on Neuroscience, Social Psychology, and Historical Observation

> This document does not assign moral judgment to any generation or nation.  
> It presents a **structural hypothesis**: that experiences during the formative years  
> (approximately ages 20–24) are highly influential in shaping long-term value frameworks  
> and default judgment patterns.  
> The purpose is explanatory, not normative.

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern societies increasingly exhibit generational divergence in:

- Risk tolerance  
- Trust in institutions  
- Expectations of the state  
- Attitudes toward growth, debt, and sustainability  

These divergences are often framed as ideological conflicts or moral failures.  
This document proposes an alternative explanation:

> **Many of these differences originate from distinct formative-year experiences,  
> rather than conscious ideological choices.**

## 2. The Formative Years Hypothesis (20–24)

### 2.1 Neuroscientific Basis (Summary)

- The prefrontal cortex continues maturing into the mid-20s.
- During this period, the brain consolidates:
  - Long-term planning
  - Risk evaluation
  - Responsibility attribution
  - Impulse regulation
- After this stage, value frameworks remain adaptable but at significantly higher cognitive and emotional cost.

This suggests that ages **20–24 function as a “default configuration phase”**  
for long-term judgment systems rather than a period of fixed belief acquisition.

### 2.2 Social and Psychological Foundations

Relevant concepts include:

- Cohort effects  
- Formative years hypothesis  
- Generational imprinting  

Across disciplines, findings converge on a common insight:

> Experiences during early adulthood strongly influence  
> how individuals interpret uncertainty, authority, and collective responsibility for decades.

## 3. Core Hypothesis

> **Experiences encountered during ages 20–24 are likely to establish  
> the default value framework and judgment heuristics  
> that persist throughout adulthood.**

This does not imply determinism.  
Rather, it explains why later persuasion often fails across generations  
despite access to identical information.

## 4. Cross-National Observations (Brief)

Comparable patterns can be observed internationally:

- United States  
  - Great Depression cohorts  
  - 2008 Global Financial Crisis cohorts
- Europe  
  - Post-war welfare-state cohorts  
  - Eurozone crisis cohorts
- Global  
  - COVID-era digital-native cohorts

Across contexts, **formative exposure to scarcity, instability, or expansion  
correlates strongly with long-term value orientation.**

## 5. Case Study: South Korea as a High-Compression Example

> South Korea is referenced here not as a normative model,  
> but as a **high-compression observational case** in which multiple generational value shifts  
> occurred within a short historical timeframe.

### 5.1 Generational Formative Environments

- **1950s-born cohort**  
  - Formative years: 1970s  
  - Environment: Rapid industrial growth, state-led development  
  - Default framework: Organizational trust, endurance, growth certainty

- **1960s-born cohort**  
  - Formative years: 1980s  
  - Environment: Democratization movements with residual growth  
  - Default framework: Rights gained through struggle, institutional change as achievable

- **Late 1970s–early 1980s-born cohort**  
  - Formative years: IMF crisis period  
  - Environment: Structural collapse, employment insecurity  
  - Default framework: Conditional trust, individual survival logic

- **Mid-1990s-born cohort**  
  - Formative years: Low-growth normalization  
  - Environment: Inequality narratives, mobility skepticism  
  - Default framework: Structural distrust, expectation minimization

- **Early-2000s-born cohort**  
  - Formative years: Post-COVID era  
  - Environment: Persistent uncertainty, digital mediation  
  - Default framework: Fluid identity, low stability expectation

This compression allows unusually clear observation of the hypothesis in practice.

## 6. Interpretation Principles

- These differences are **not moral failings**.
- They do not indicate intelligence or virtue disparities.
- They reflect **different formative data inputs into judgment systems**.

Generational conflict, therefore, is better understood as  
**OS-level incompatibility rather than ideological hostility.**

---

## 7. Implications for Ethics, Policy, and System Design

- Persuasion failure may result from value-framework mismatch, not ignorance.
- One-size-fits-all messaging across generations is structurally inefficient.
- Ethical OS and institutional design should account for formative-year divergence rather than deny it.

## 8. Conclusion

> The formative-years hypothesis does not justify generational positions.  
> It explains them.

Understanding this structure reduces moralization,  
improves predictability, and enables more realistic system design  
in an era of low growth, high uncertainty, and generational overlap.

This document records the hypothesis as a background reference.
