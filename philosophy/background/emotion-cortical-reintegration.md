# Emotion–Cortical Reintegration Model  
### Time-Based Neural Transition in the Biotrans Emotion System  

---

## 1. Overview  

This document explains how emotional experiences evolve through cortical reintegration — the process by which **emotion becomes cognition, and cognition matures into repentance and renewal**.  
It defines the typical six-week recovery rhythm observed in emotional ethics and trust formation.

## 2. The Biotrans 6-Week Reintegration Timeline  

| Week | Neural Focus | Emotional State | Function | Ethical Note |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Week 1 – Impact Phase** | Amygdala (limbic dominance) | Shock, reaction, denial | Emotional recognition | Avoid immediate moral judgment |
| **Week 2 – Disorientation** | Amygdala + Nucleus Accumbens | Craving, regret, fatigue | Dopamine fluctuation | Rest; prevent compulsive reaction |
| **Week 3 – Reflection Phase** | Prefrontal Cortex reactivation | Analysis, sadness, humility | Start of moral processing | Encourage reflection, journaling |
| **Week 4 – Meaning Reconstruction** | Hippocampus + PFC integration | Clarity, remorse, gratitude | Cognitive alignment | Refrain from emotional re-stimulation |
| **Week 5 – Reintegration** | ACC / PCC activation | Forgiveness, empathy | Neural synchronization | Safe to re-engage emotionally |
| **Week 6 – Resonance Stability** | Default Mode Network balance | Peace, acceptance | Ethical stabilization | Recovered readiness for trust |

## 3. Structural Interpretation  

- The **amygdala** initiates emotional memory.  
- The **prefrontal cortex** translates that memory into reflection and choice.  
- The **hippocampus** encodes meaning, creating moral understanding.  
- Finally, the **default mode network (DMN)** establishes internal coherence, allowing emotion and morality to resonate.

## 4. Ethical Implications  

| Phase | Risk | Required Virtue | Design Guidance |
|--------|------|------------------|----------------|
| **Impact** | Manipulation by fear | Patience | No emotional input collection |
| **Reflection** | Overthinking or guilt | Compassion | Offer calm, non-reactive context |
| **Reintegration** | Emotional shortcuts | Perseverance | Allow 4–6 week trust rebuild before stimuli |
| **Resonance** | Complacency | Gratitude | Sustain through consistent empathy signals |

---

## 5. Summary  

1. Emotion without reflection leads to chaos; reflection without time leads to burnout.  
2. True ethical cognition emerges when emotion, time, and neural recovery are aligned.  
3. Biotrans regards **repentance not as guilt**, but as the reintegration of emotion into moral stability.
