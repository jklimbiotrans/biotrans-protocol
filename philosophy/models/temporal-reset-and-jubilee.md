## 1. Observation: Why the World Looks Different on Certain Days

Many people report a recurring experience on specific days:

- January 1st
- Birthdays
- The first day after moving
- Entry into or release from institutional life
- The first day of a new job or school term

On these days, familiar spaces often appear:
- visually sharper,
- richer in detail,
- perceptually “new.”

This phenomenon is not well explained as mood alone.
It is more plausibly described as a **cognitive state change**
triggered by the recognition of a temporal boundary.

---

## 2. Cognitive Mechanisms Behind Temporal Reset

### 2.1 Release of Predictive Compression

In daily life, the brain rarely processes environments in full resolution.
Instead, it relies on **predictive compression**—
reconstructing perception from prior memory to conserve resources.

Strong temporal boundary signals interrupt this process.
The brain temporarily suspends prior predictions and reopens sensory input,
resulting in heightened perceptual clarity.

---

### 2.2 Re-segmentation by the Prefrontal System

Temporal segmentation—distinguishing beginnings and endings—
is closely associated with prefrontal functions.

Signals such as:
- “previous phase ended”
- “new phase begins”

reduce automatic cognitive routines
and increase attentional allocation.

---

### 2.3 Dopamine Shift to Exploration Mode

Dopamine is less a pleasure signal than a
**novelty detection and learning readiness signal**.

Temporal boundaries activate:
- uncertainty,
- possibility,
- choice space,

shifting cognition into an exploratory mode
and enhancing memory encoding.

---

## 3. The “Day-One Effect”

These mechanisms collectively produce what many describe as:

> “Seeing the world like a game on Day One.”

During this phase:
- sensory gain increases,
- memory encoding strengthens,
- experiential anchor points form.

This explains why beginnings are remembered
with disproportionate clarity.

## 4. Structural Reinterpretation of Jubilee

Historically, jubilees have included:
- debt release,
- liberation from bonded labor,
- restoration of land or status.

From a cognitive perspective, however,
a jubilee can be understood as:

> **A system-level alignment with moments
> when human cognition is most receptive to reset.**

Rather than a moral demand,
a jubilee functions as a **temporally explicit reset protocol**
designed around human cognitive constraints.

---

## 5. Reset as Structure, Not Emotion

Several clarifications are necessary:

- Reset is not a mood.
- Reset is not awakening.
- Reset is not forgetfulness.

Reset is an **observable cognitive event**
that can be anticipated and structurally utilized.

Accordingly, mechanisms such as:
- periodic clearing of accumulated penalties,
- restoration of future possibility,
- prevention of irreversible identity fixation,

are cognitively necessary features
of human-centered systems.

---

## 6. Ethics Systems and Periodic Reset

Without reset mechanisms, systems tend toward:
- permanent accumulation of past errors,
- rigid identity classification,
- loss of recovery pathways.

Such systems conflict with human cognitive architecture.

An ethical system must therefore include not only judgment,
but also **explicit reset timing**.

Jubilees represent the longest-cycle implementation of this principle,
while yearly, monthly, or version-based resets
serve as scaled-down analogues.

---

## 7. What This Model Does Not Claim

This document does **not** claim that:

- temporal reset solves all ethical problems,
- cognition fully resets or erases memory,
- religious tradition is scientifically proven.

Its sole purpose is to explain:

> **Why reset structures repeatedly emerge
> in human ethical, institutional, and protocol designs,
> when humans are the operating agents.**

---

## 8. Summary

- Humans exhibit measurable cognitive changes at temporal boundaries.
- These changes affect perception, attention, and memory encoding.
- Jubilee-like structures align with these cognitive properties.
- Reset mechanisms are not optional morality,
  but structural requirements for long-term human systems.

Reset is not a matter of belief.
It is a matter of **cognitive compatibility**.

## Appendix A. Cognitive Interpretation of Jubilee Cycles (33·77·111)

This appendix interprets the
**33-year, 77-year, and 111-year jubilee cycles**
used in Biotrans Protocol
from a cognitive and structural perspective,
rather than a symbolic or theological one.

---

### A.1 Why Cycles Are Necessary

Human cognition exhibits several constraints:

- errors accumulate,
- judgments solidify,
- contextual flexibility decays over time.

A system that allows indefinite accumulation
without reset becomes cognitively unsustainable.

Periodic reset is therefore not moral generosity,
but a **load-balancing mechanism for human cognition**.

---

### A.2 The 33-Year Cycle: Individual Cognitive Reset Threshold

Thirty-three years roughly corresponds to:

- the consolidation of adult identity narratives,
- the point at which self-description becomes rigid,
- the merging of past evaluation with present possibility.

A 33-year reset represents
the last practical window
to cognitively separate past record from future agency.

This aligns with:
- personal repentance,
- penalty dissolution,
- structured re-entry into possibility.

---

### A.3 The 77-Year Cycle: Collective and DAO Memory Reordering

Seventy-seven years typically spans:
- more than one generational turnover,
- distortion or mythologization of founding intent,
- rule preservation overtaking original purpose.

Without reset, systems drift toward self-maintenance.

A 77-year reset allows:
- re-alignment of rules with intent,
- correction of institutional memory,
- restoration of interpretive flexibility.

---

### A.4 The 111-Year Cycle: Ethical Charter Renewal Limit

At approximately 111 years:

- all direct witnesses are gone,
- only textual records remain,
- contextual understanding collapses.

At this stage, ethical charters risk:
- becoming untouchable dogma,
- being repurposed as authority instruments.

Renewal at this cycle is not destruction of ethics,
but **cognitive resuscitation of ethical meaning**.

---

### A.5 On the Meaning of the Numbers

Although these numbers may appear symbolic,
they are treated here as:

- memorable temporal spans,
- cognitive manageability thresholds,
- design-stable intervals.

They are not sacred by belief,
but **functional by human memory and comprehension**.

---

### A.6 Summary of the Appendix

- Jubilee cycles function as cognitive preservation mechanisms.
- 33, 77, and 111 years correspond to individual, collective, and charter-level limits.
- Ethics without reset accumulates until it overwhelms cognition.

Periodic reset is not forgiveness alone.
It is a **precondition for sustainable human-centered systems**.
