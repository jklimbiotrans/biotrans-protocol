# Observation on Emotional Commodification and AI Simulation (2025–2035 Outlook)

**Biotrans Protocol – Development History Note**

## 1. Background Observation
As of 2025, even in simple job recruitment processes,  
a noticeable change has been observed in the way early 20s youth express emotions.  
While smiles or reactions may appear on the surface, there is often a lack of genuine emotional depth.  
Conversations and behaviors tend toward formalized, scripted responses rather than spontaneous human warmth.

## 2. Phenomenon Definition – “Emotion = Expression = Commodity”
Emotional expression is increasingly detached from the authentic inner state  
and has become a skill or product optimized for compensation or social advantage.  
Smiles, politeness, and empathy are frequently trained and deployed in professional or social contexts  
rather than emerging as natural, uncalculated responses.  

This model has already been normalized across social media, customer service, and content industries,  
and younger generations are unconsciously internalizing it.

## 3. Social Impact
- **Collapse of Authenticity**: Trust in others’ emotions weakens  
  as the gap between outward expression and inner reality widens.  
- **Emotional Fatigue**: Prolonged “emotional labor” without authenticity depletes psychological energy.  
- **Weakened Community Bonds**: When emotions are treated as tradable commodities,  
  human interaction shifts from genuine exchange to transactional exchange.

## 4. Biotrans Protocol Perspective
The Biotrans Protocol Ethical OS considers **emotional authenticity** and **autonomy**  
as non-negotiable principles.  
In a society where emotions are commodified,  
AI and robots simulating emotions further erode the perceived value of real human feelings.  

The Ethical OS should prioritize:
1. Encouraging genuine emotional expression.  
2. Allowing voluntary and selective sharing of emotions.  
3. Avoiding mandatory emotional scoring or public ranking systems.

## 5. Conclusion – Early Warning Significance
The “emotional zombification” expected to accelerate between **2030 and 2035**  
is already observable in specific social sectors by 2025.  
This is not simply a cultural evolution but a structural signal  
highlighting the urgency of protecting human emotional integrity.  

The Biotrans Protocol will document this phenomenon historically  
and integrate its findings into the future **Emotional Authenticity Restoration OS** design.

**Description:**  
Field note for the Biotrans Protocol documenting early signs of emotional detachment among younger generations, linked to AI emotion simulation and transactional social behaviors. Serves as a reference point for future Ethical OS development and community design.
