# Biotrans Protocol – Expression and Emotion Simulation (Concise Version)

## Core Declaration
- Expression — through speech, writing, or nonverbal signals — is a creative force that shapes the life direction of both individuals and communities.  
- AI’s simulation of emotions is a dangerous function that imitates this power.  
- AI must be designed according to the principle of **protecting the vulnerable**.  

## Principles of Prevention
- AI, like nuclear weapons, requires safety mechanisms.  
- Designing AI around the vulnerable ensures:  
  - Potential harm to others is naturally reduced.  
  - Since the number of nodes required to safeguard life and human rights decreases, social costs are reduced and computational efficiency improves.
