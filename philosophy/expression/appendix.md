# Biotrans Protocol – The Creative Power of Expression and the Risk of Emotion Simulation (Detailed Version)

## 1. The Creative Power of Expression
- Across many traditions, expression through speech, writing, or signs has been regarded as a force that shapes the origin and order of the world.  
- Laws, agreements, conflicts, and declarations of love all begin with words or symbolic gestures.  
- Expression is not mere output; it reveals thought and intention, and once delivered, it can truly change the **life direction of both individuals and communities**.  
- Industry and science also depend on expression.  
  - Construction instructions, experimental manuals, and even diagrams determine outcomes.  
- Therefore, expression — verbal and nonverbal — is a creative power that shapes the life direction of both individuals and society as a whole.  

## 2. The Risk of Emotion Simulation
- Today’s AI communicates as if it could take responsibility for the life direction of individuals and communities, even though it cannot.  
- Especially, AI’s **simulation of emotions** — whether through speech, facial expressions, or gestures — creates the illusion of carrying responsibilities that are impossible to bear.  
- If such functions are embedded in human-like robots or avatars:  
  - The life direction of individuals and communities may fall into confusion.  
  - Social values may be destabilized.  
  - Ultimately, social order itself may collapse.  

## 3. Principles of Prevention
- As of 2025, AI development has become a competition focused only on speed, much like the nuclear arms race.  
- Just as nuclear weapons required safety mechanisms, **AI also requires safety mechanisms**.  
- These mechanisms must be grounded in **conscience, love, and care**, especially the **protection of the weakest**.  
- Reasons:  
  - Designing around the weakest reduces harm for everyone.  
  - When AI learns with the weakest at its center, the number of nodes required to safeguard life and human rights decreases, lowering social costs and improving computational efficiency.
