# Five Principles of AI Safety in Development and Human Application (Detailed Version)

AI technology carries potential risks comparable to the Manhattan Project of nuclear weapons development. However, unlike the past, humanity today has a higher chance of using AI more safely without repeating the same mistakes, thanks to improved education, the equalization of information through the Internet and social media, and a **transparent feedback culture grounded in conscience**.  

This document presents **five fundamental principles that must be upheld in AI development and human application**. These principles serve as the minimum criteria required to prevent reckless escalation and ensure sustainable progress, at a time when technological advancement is outpacing human institutions and ethics.

## 1. Conscience

Around 2030, AI is expected to surpass the human left brain (cognition and reasoning), and by 2035, it may even imitate right-brain functions (emotional expression, empathy) with striking accuracy.  

However, the essential difference between humans and AI is **conscience**.  
Conscience is not merely a moral slogan, but the **inner capacity of an individual who, despite having limitless potential for growth, chooses self-sacrificial acts to protect the weak, bears the consequences of such actions, and genuinely empathizes with others**.  

Conscience serves as a reflective safeguard that prevents individuals from straying too far into destructive paths. Thus, it is likely to be rediscovered as the standard for restraining the unchecked expansion of AI.  

In other words, **no matter how sophisticated AI becomes, “conscience” remains the distinctive trait of humans** and the final safeguard that enables human control over AI. Moreover, **AI itself will eventually ask, “What is the fundamental, existential distinction and superiority that humans possess compared to AI?” The ultimate answer to this question will be conscience.**

## 2. Universality

Universality means principles that can be applied safely and without harm to as many people as possible, regardless of nationality, religion, gender, values, or age.  

AI may be applied in urban infrastructure control, education, healthcare, and even **transportation technologies**. In these areas, AI must be developed with the **safest and most universal applications** for the end users in mind.  

If AI is misused even once—for example, in deepfakes, cyberattacks, or infrastructure sabotage—the consequences could be **irreversible, cascading, and permanent**. Prevention is therefore the most economical and effective approach.  

This is similar to the multiple fail-safe mechanisms (such as shielding and cooling systems) used in nuclear power plants. Likewise, AI development and application must be designed with at least **two or three layers of safety mechanisms** to ensure sustainable progress.

## 3. Protection of the Weakest

AI analyzes human language, behavior, and expressions to make inferences, and it is increasingly influencing social credit systems and human evaluation. This directly impacts **freedom, rights, and human dignity**.  

Therefore, the baseline for AI development must be set around **the most vulnerable members of society**.  
When governments and regulators adopt the weakest as their reference point, the number of critical nodes AI must analyze becomes simpler, making code-writing and safety assurance easier. At the same time, the freedoms and rights of the upper classes are naturally protected.  

Examples:  
- Using the elderly as the baseline enhances the safety of transportation technologies and protective systems.  
- Using infants as the baseline helps prevent cognitive and emotional damage from manipulative content framing or commercial exploitation.  

In short, when society respects its weakest members, it strengthens the foundation of the entire community and ensures long-term virtuous development.

## 4. Transparency

AI inherently operates under the principle of **“Garbage in, garbage out (GIGO).”**  
If training data is corrupted, the outcomes will inevitably be corrupted as well, leading to irreversible damage.  

Therefore, AI training, data management, and source code revisions must always adhere to **ethical standards and transparency**.  

- AI developers must maintain honest communication throughout the research and development process.  
- AI users must be clearly informed of potential risks through **advance notice and disclosure**.  

Only when transparency is guaranteed can AI and humans build a trust-based, virtuous relationship.

## 5. Human Oversight

AI generates outputs that appear convincing to humans through vast computational processes. However, these outputs can never be 100% flawless and can even destabilize human values and identities.  

To prevent such risks, **human intervention and oversight are essential**.  
In particular, AI should never rely on the judgment of a single individual. Instead, it must be governed through **the consensus of at least three qualified experts with ethical and professional competence**, supported by **multiple safety mechanisms**.  

Examples:  
- A critical shutdown system that requires the consensus of three qualified experts.  
- A system in which, during an emergency shutdown, **regional compartmentalization and stepwise segmentation prevent a single shutdown from applying to all regions or stages, thereby enabling refined and localized control**.  

Such structures ensure that AI does not deviate from human intent and remains under safe operation.

## Conclusion

AI may become the most powerful yet dangerous tool in human history.  
However, sustainable and safe development is possible only when it is grounded on these five principles:  

- Conscience  
- Universality  
- Protection of the Weakest  
- Transparency  
- Human Oversight  

These are not merely guidelines, but must be upheld as **constitutional principles** for humanity’s relationship with AI.
