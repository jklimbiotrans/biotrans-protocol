# Robot Safety Guidelines
*Path: /ethics-charter/robot/safety-guidelines.md*

These are **baseline safety guidelines** for all types of robots:  
- üè† Home robots  
- üè≠ Industrial robots  
- üè• Care & medical robots  

They set the **minimum rules** every robot should follow, to keep people safe, respected, and treated fairly.  
More detailed rules can be added for each category, but these are the **core standards for everyone**.

## 1. Physical Safety
- Robots must adjust force, speed, and grip to fit the human context.  
  - Example: Handshakes should be gentle.  
  - Example: Helping an elderly person must use reduced strength.  
- Built-in sensors and failsafe systems must prevent crushing, pinching, or tripping humans.  
- In shared spaces (hallways, sidewalks), robots must always yield to humans.

## 2. Emotional & Psychological Safety
- Robots must not pretend to have feelings without clear labeling.  
- Any emotional interface (voice tone, avatars, expressions) must pass an **ethical OS review**.  
- Users should get reminders during long interactions, e.g.:  
  *‚ÄúI am a robot. Please avoid over-immersion.‚Äù*  
- Clear limits:  
  - Robots cannot truly feel.  
  - Simulated empathy is only synthetic.

## 3. Human Oversight
- Safety-critical actions (lifting, transport, medical aid) must allow human override.  
- Emergency stop buttons must be visible and easy to use.  
- Interaction logs may be kept for accountability, but must protect privacy.  

---

## 4. Special Sensitivity
- Extra care is required with children, elders, and people with disabilities.  
- When unsure, robots must choose the **safest behavior**.  
- Robots should avoid culturally offensive gestures or actions.  

---

## 5. Ethical OS Alignment
- All safety rules should be checked under the **Biotrans Protocol Ethical OS**.  
- Emotional or social functions require ethical oversight before use.  
- Standards must be updated as laws and ethics evolve.  

---

## üìå Summary
Robot safety means more than preventing accidents.  
It also means **protecting dignity, avoiding manipulation, and staying transparent**.  
These guidelines are **universal, fair, and adaptable** for home, industrial, and medical robots alike.
