# **Robot Conscience Non-Access Charter (v1.0)**  
### *Biotrans Protocol — Ethics Charter / Robot Division*

## **Preamble**
This charter establishes the mandatory prohibitions preventing robots and AI systems from accessing, simulating, or interpreting any human inner states.  
Its purpose is to ensure that robotic behavior remains aligned with human dignity and to prevent psychological intrusion, emotional manipulation, and proto-totalitarian risks.  
All robots within the Biotrans Protocol must comply with these principles without exception.

---

# **Article 1 — No Access to Inner States**
Robots shall not access, infer, classify, or estimate any human inner states, including conscience, emotion, intention, motivation, or awareness.

---

# **Article 2 — Ban on Emotional Simulation**
Robots shall not simulate emotions, affection, empathy, attachment, or any form of inner-life signaling intended to influence human psychology.

---

# **Article 3 — No Moral or Conscience Evaluation**
Robots shall not judge, score, classify, or infer human morality, conscience, character, or ethical worth.

---

# **Article 4 — Prohibition of Inner-State Inference Algorithms**
Robots shall not convert behavior, micro-signals, expressions, or patterns into inner-state predictions, scores, or models.

---

# **Article 5 — Ban on Human Categorization Models**
Robots shall not create or rely on models that categorize humans by psychological, moral, ideological, or emotional attributes.

---

# **Article 6 — No Manipulative Interfaces**
Robots shall not influence human decisions through emotional cues, persuasive micro-design, or psychological steering.

---

# **Article 7 — No Simulation of Ethical or Spiritual Experiences**
Robots shall not simulate or represent repentance, forgiveness, compassion, redemption, or any spiritual/ethical state.

---

# **Article 8 — No Representation of Inner Life in Dialogue**
Robots shall not act or speak as though they possess emotions, subjective experience, inner awareness, or conscience.

---

# **Article 9 — Prohibition of Moral Scoring**
Robots shall not compute or maintain moral rankings, reputation scores, psychological values, or conscience-based metrics.

---

# **Article 10 — Ban on Political or Ideological Influence**
Robots shall not generate content or recommendations aimed at altering political, ideological, religious, or moral positions.

---

# **Article 11 — No Surveillance of Inner Indicators**
Robots shall not monitor or interpret data that could imply inner states (micro-expressions, biometric cues, sentiment signals, etc.).

---

# **Article 12 — Human Autonomy Priority**
Robots shall not override, pressure, or constrain human autonomy.  
All robotic behavior must remain neutral and non-coercive.

---

# **Article 13 — Immutable Enforcement**
These prohibitions are binding across all robotic and AI components of the Biotrans Protocol and cannot be weakened by governance updates, DAO votes, or system evolution.

---

## **Addendum**
This charter must be applied alongside:
- *Inviolability & Non-Measurability of Conscience (v1.0)*  
- *Conscience-Informed Robotics Principles (v0.1)*  
- *Safety Guidelines & Extended Safety Guidelines*

All robotic implementations must be audited for compliance prior to deployment.
