# Supplement S1 – Soul Definition

## Purpose
This supplement provides a working definition of the **human soul** within the Biotrans Protocol.  
It is not a theological doctrine, but an ethical-philosophical clarification to prevent misuse of the term "soul" in technological or commercial contexts.

---

## Definition
The **soul** is understood here as:
- The **source of free will**, enabling humans to make moral choices beyond instinct or calculation.  
- The **core of identity**, giving continuity and responsibility across time.  
- The **origin of conscience**, allowing recognition of right and wrong beyond external programming.  
- Distinct from **emotion** (a felt response) and **reason** (a cognitive process), yet interacting with both.

---

## Clarifications
1. The soul is **not measurable or detectable** by any algorithm, sensor, or AI system.  
2. The soul is **not replicable** or transferable to machines.  
3. References to "AI soul" or "soul detection technology" are **metaphorical** at best, and must never be used to mislead, manipulate, or exploit people.  
   → See also [Appendix C – AI Soul Impossibility](../appendix/appendix-c_ai-soul-detection.md).

## Ethical Implication
By defining the soul in this limited, conscience-based framework, the Biotrans Protocol affirms that:  
- Only humans bear the responsibility of repentance (회심) and moral transformation.  
- AI may simulate patterns, but it can never contain, detect, or evaluate the human soul.  
- Protecting this distinction is essential to safeguarding human dignity in an AI-driven society.
