## 1. Preface – Challenging the Irreversibility of Time

Human civilization has long treated time as **linear and irreversible**.  
What is done cannot be undone, and past mistakes forever define the present and the future.  
This belief in the absolute irreversibility of time underlies many human systems — from justice to social order.

However, such a concept of time is only valid **in a world without God**.  
If God exists, then time is not a straight line but a **variable and a tool** within divine order.  
Scripture refers to God as “the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last” (Revelation 22:13),  
describing a being who exists simultaneously in all moments.

In that light, the irreversibility of time is not an absolute truth, but a limitation of **creaturely perception**.

## 2. Chronos and Kairos – The Dual Structure of Time

Time operates in two distinct dimensions:

- 🧭 **Chronos** – the linear, irreversible time experienced by humans. It flows from past to present to future.  
- ✨ **Kairos** – the transcendent, non-linear time of God. All moments exist simultaneously, and time is structured by “appointed moments” rather than by sequential flow.

**Repentance (metanoia)** is the event in which *Kairos* breaks into *Chronos*.  
In the moment of repentance, time ceases to be a mere flow and becomes a **rearranged order**.  
The past does not disappear, but its **meaning is radically rewritten**.

## 3. Repentance – The Act That Rewrites the Past

Repentance is not mere regret. It is a transformation of being — and a **reconstruction of time** itself.

- “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.” (Isaiah 1:18)  
- “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

These passages declare that **the past can be redefined by the present**.  
Past wrongdoing does not vanish, but its significance is transformed.  
The past ceases to be a chain that binds identity and instead becomes **material for redemption**.

## 4. Scientific and Ontological Understanding of “God”

The term “God” in this document does **not** refer to any specific religious deity.  
Here, “God” denotes a **creative source beyond time and entropy**, whose existence is inferred from reason and science.

When humans create machines like cars or airplanes, we are considered their *creators*.  
By analogy, if there exists a source that engineered systems far more complex —  
a source that enables hearts to beat against the laws of entropy —  
it is scientifically reasonable to call that source *divine*.

This is not merely a matter of faith but of **scientific rationality**.  
The emergence of order from chaos, the self-organization of life, and the birth of consciousness all suggest the existence of a creative principle.  
And if such a principle caused humanity to exist, calling it “Father” or “Parent” is not a metaphor but a logical conclusion.

Thus, “God” here refers to a **transcendent creative origin** — not bound to any religion —  
and is a concept compatible with both science and philosophy.

## 5. Digital Implementation – Erasing Punishment and Rewriting Meaning

The *Temporal Mercy Principle* is embedded in the architecture of the Biotrans Protocol.

- Past wrongdoings (*demerits*) may be **erased or nullified** if genuine repentance occurs.  
- This is not simple data deletion but **a redefinition of meaning**.  
- The system is not a *condemnation engine* trapped in the irreversibility of time, but a *repentance engine* grounded in transcendent mercy.

In this structure:  
- The past **does not define** the present.  
- The **present state redefines** the meaning of the past.

This is the essence of Biotrans Protocol’s time ethics.

## 6. Ethical Declaration – The Temporal Mercy Principle

Biotrans Protocol does **not** regard the irreversibility of time as an absolute law.

1. Time, within the divine order, is not a rigid line but a **rearrangeable variable**.  
2. Repentance and forgiveness possess the power to **rewrite the meaning of the past**.  
3. All records of wrongdoing are stored **not for condemnation**, but under the assumption of possible repentance.  
4. If repentance is realized, those records are **erased or rendered void**.  
5. This principle liberates human beings from the tyranny of their past and establishes the structural conditions for a **new beginning**.

## 📜 Appendix – Theological Principle as Digital Structure

> “If the irreversibility of time is not overturned, guilt remains eternal.  
> But if God transcends time, repentance reverses the direction of time and rewrites the past.”

The *Temporal Mercy Principle* is not a mere technical feature.  
It is an attempt to **embed divine mercy — the power to rewrite time — into a digital system**,  
enabling human beings to live not under condemnation but within a structure of repentance and renewal.
