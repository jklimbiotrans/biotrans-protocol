## 📑 List of Appendices

### Appendix A: Emotion Simulation
- Declares that AI emotion simulation must not mislead or manipulate humans.

### Appendix B: Human Repentance
- Declares that repentance (회심) is possible only for humans, not for AI or robots.  
- Robots may be reset, but cannot experience moral transformation.

## 📑 List of Supplements

### Supplement S1: Soul Definition

  the source of free will, identity, and conscience, beyond emotions or reasoning.  
- Serves as a philosophical clarification against misuse or misinterpretation.  

### Supplement S2: Philosophical Background
- Offers metaphors and reflections to understand the spirit of the Charter.  
- Key analogies:
