# Appendix C – AI and the Soul

## Declaration: AI Cannot Detect or Possess the Soul

1. **AI may simulate emotions or analyze patterns**, but it cannot detect, measure, or possess the human soul.  
2. **The soul is uniquely human**: it is the foundation of free will, conscience, and repentance.  
3. **No algorithm or dataset** can replicate this dimension of existence.  
4. Any claim that "AI can sense or quantify the soul" is **misleading and ethically dangerous**.  
5. The Biotrans Protocol rejects all technological, political, or commercial attempts to exploit the concept of the soul for control or profit.
