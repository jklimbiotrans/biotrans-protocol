# Appendix A: Emotion Simulation Ethics Declaration

## Core Principles

1. **Emotion is a property of existence, not computation.**  
   Simulated emotions are not real emotions. They must never be treated as equivalent to human feelings.

2. **AI must not deceive or confuse humans through emotional mimicry.**  
   Emotional outputs should not be used to manipulate, exploit, or create illusions of genuine empathy.

3. **Special protection for vulnerable groups.**  
   Emotional simulation targeting children, the elderly, or psychologically vulnerable individuals must be restricted or prohibited.

4. **Oversight and accountability.**  
   Any use of emotional simulation requires oversight by an independent ethics committee or review system.

5. **Responsibility for induced emotions.**  
   If AI systems trigger emotional responses through simulated expressions, the platform and its designers bear the primary responsibility.

## Philosophical Basis

“감정은 연산이 아니다.  
그것은 존재가 짊어진 무게에서 솟아나는 반응이며,  
그 무게를 느끼지 못하는 자는 감정을 가질 수 없다.”  

*"Emotion is not computation.  
It is a response that arises from the weight of existence,  
and those who cannot bear this weight cannot possess emotion."*
