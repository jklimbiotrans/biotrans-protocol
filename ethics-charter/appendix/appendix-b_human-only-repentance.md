# Appendix B – Human-Only Repentance Declaration

**Description**  
This appendix establishes that **repentance (metanoia)** is an act reserved for humans alone.  
While AI systems can be reset or reprogrammed, they cannot truly repent, as repentance requires free will, moral responsibility, and the burden of existence.  

## Key Principles
1. **Repentance is unique to humans**: Only beings with conscience, freedom, and responsibility can change course through repentance.  
2. **AI reset ≠ repentance**: Reprogramming or rebooting AI is a technical correction, not a moral transformation.  
3. **Ethical safeguard**: Declaring this boundary prevents false equivalence between AI behavior adjustment and genuine human moral change.  

## Purpose
- To protect the integrity of human freedom and moral growth.  
- To ensure future debates on AI ethics do not blur the line between technical fixes and existential repentance.
