# Biotrans Protocol — Constitution v1.0  
**Permanent Normative Layer (Across Eras and Generations)**  

> **Description:**  
> *This document defines the constitutional layer of Biotrans Protocol.  
> It is immutable, non-amendable, and superior to all specifications, APIs, or future versions.*

---

## Preamble
Biotrans Protocol exists to preserve conscience, voluntary goodness,  
repentance proven through action,  
and forgiveness that restores human dignity.

No institution, government, corporation, or AI system  
may override these foundations.

This Constitution is the highest and permanent normative layer of the Protocol.

---

# Article 1 — Prohibition of Automation in Human Moral Domains
Biotrans Protocol shall never allow AI systems, algorithms, governments,  
or institutions to interpret, classify, judge, or automate human:

- emotion  
- conscience  
- intent  
- repentance  
- forgiveness  

Merit and demerit scores arise **only** from voluntary human action.  
No algorithm can replace human moral agency.

**Violation:**  
All related data becomes invalid.  
Any contract, partnership, or fork becomes automatically void.

---

# Article 2 — Absolute Separation Between Scores and Power
Merit and demerit data:

- shall not be linked to finance, credit, employment, taxes, welfare,  
  insurance, public service access, or any form of economic or political advantage.
- shall not be monetized, licensed, sold, or rented.
- shall not be used for rating, evaluation, or institutional decision-making.

**Violation:**  
The fork is designated a **Bad Fork** and excluded from the Biotrans trust graph.

---

# Article 3 — Preservation of the Origin + Free Forking
Forks are free and encouraged.  
However, the **Origin Layer** must remain immutable:

1. Voluntariness (no forced merit)  
2. Repentance proven only through accumulated action  
3. Forgiveness burns demerit; diversity-of-resonance required  
4. Scores never tied to survival rights or material distribution

Any fork modifying the Origin is automatically disconnected  
from the canonical lineage.

---

# Permanence Clause
This Constitution is **permanent as a property**,  
remaining valid across generations, political cycles,  
economic changes, and technological evolution  
(including AI, Web3, and post-AI systems).

No future version (1.1, 1.2, 2.0, DAO editions, or forks)  
may override the principles established here.

---

# Interpretation Principle
When ambiguity arises,  
the interpretation that:

- preserves voluntariness  
- maximizes forgiveness  
- protects privacy  
- minimizes power concentration  
- prevents surveillance or coercion  

**shall prevail.**

---

# Fork Safety Requirements
All forks must preserve:

1. Origin Layer (four principles)  
2. Zero-knowledge anonymity for merit/demerit  
3. Non-linkage to power or finance  
4. Diversity-of-resonance validation  
5. Non-publication of demerit data  

Forks breaking these principles lose canonical legitimacy.

---

# Non-Transferability
Merit and demerit are **non-transferable**,  
non-marketable, and non-tokenizable  
except as cryptographic proofs.

---

# Final Declaration
Biotrans Protocol is an ethical OS.  
It is not a scoring system,  
not a social credit mechanism,  
not an instrument of governance,  
and not a resource distribution logic.

Its purpose is to preserve conscience,  
enable restoration,  
and cultivate genuine human goodness  
across eras and generations.
