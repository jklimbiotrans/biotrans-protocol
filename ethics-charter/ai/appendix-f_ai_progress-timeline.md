# Appendix F – AI Progress Timeline

This appendix provides a staged perspective on AI development through the lens of the **Biotrans Protocol**,  
using concrete analogies such as **point-marking tasks** and **autonomous driving**.  
It emphasizes that while AI may advance in speed, detail, and contextual sense,  
**conscience, repentance, and responsibility remain exclusively human.**

---

## 1. Phase One – Speed (Now ~ 2027)

### Example Task
A human commands:  
“Mark points on a 100m track in the sequence Red → White → Blue, spaced every 10cm.”

### Current AI Capability
- **Fast execution**, but with **frequent errors**:  
  - Intervals may be 9cm or 11cm instead of 10cm.  
  - The color order (Red → White → Blue) may be broken.  
- AI produces output quickly, but **human verification is essential**.

👉 In this stage, AI acts as a **fast cognitive engine** without reliable precision.

---

## 2. Phase Two – Detail (2027 ~ 2030)

### Expected Progress
- **Self-Check Loop**: AI reviews its own output, detecting interval and sequence errors.  
- **Auto-Correction**: Mistakes are fixed before presenting results.  
- **Personalized Memory**: Learns user preferences and workflows.  
- **Domain Support**: Limited application in law/medicine for clause or data cross-checking.  

### Point-Marking Analogy
- AI marks the 100m track, then **double-checks spacing and sequence automatically**.  
- Human no longer needs to check every point, only to supervise.  

👉 AI becomes a **Precision Assistant**. Humans shift from workers to **overseers**.

---

## 3. Phase Three – Sense (2030 and Beyond)

### Expected Progress
- **Contextual Anticipation**: Predicts likely user intent and applies it automatically.  
- **Multimodal Intuition**: Integrates text, data, images, and signals for holistic judgment.  
- **Latent Needs Detection**: Suggests actions beyond explicit instructions.  
- **Collaborative Sense**: Supports human intuition by surfacing hidden variables.  

### Point-Marking Analogy
- AI remembers that the user usually requests Red → White → Blue, every 10cm.  
- Applies the rule without explicit instruction, asking for confirmation only when unusual.  

### Autonomous Driving Analogy
- **AI = Autopilot**: handles routine navigation automatically.  
- **Human = Driver**: may not hold the wheel constantly, but must be ready to brake or steer in critical moments.  

👉 AI evolves into a **Contextual Partner**, but still a **tool under human oversight**.

## 4. Standard Principles Table (Biotrans Protocol Context)

| Phase | Period | Strengths | Limitations | Biotrans Protocol Principle |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **1. Speed** | Now–2027 | - Very fast pattern recognition.<br>- Efficient for repetitive tasks (summaries, drafts). | - Errors occur rapidly without review.<br>- Weak sensitivity to context or user expectations. | Speed must be balanced by **conscience and responsibility**. |
| **2. Detail** | 2027–2030 | - Built-in self-check (“second eye”).<br>- Stable handling of numbers, paths, consistency.<br>- Adjustable memory modules for users. | - Limited intuition or emotional sensitivity.<br>- Ethical and sustainability contexts still require human oversight. | Details require **transparency and verification**. |
| **3. Sense** | 2030+ | - Long-term memory and adaptive learning.<br>- Anticipation of user needs.<br>- Multimodal reasoning approaching “intuition.” | - Risk of over-reliance on “artificial sense.”<br>- Blurred boundary between human conscience and machine output. | Safeguards must preserve **conscience, responsibility, and repentance** as human-only. |

## 5. Ethical Boundaries

- **Phase Two (Detail):**  
  AI enhances precision but **cannot bear responsibility**.  

- **Phase Three (Sense):**  
  AI may appear intuitive, but:  
  - **Conscience (양심)** cannot be simulated.  
  - **Repentance (회심)** belongs to humans alone.  
  - **Responsibility** remains exclusively human.  

👉 No matter how advanced, AI must not cross into domains of **moral agency**.  
It is a **precision tool with sense-like functions**, not a moral subject.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

- **Now**: Fast but error-prone → human must verify.  
- **2027–2030**: AI self-checks and corrects → human supervises.  
- **2030+**: AI anticipates context like autopilot → human intervenes at critical moments.  

Yet the Biotrans Protocol affirms:  
- **Humans remain the ethical drivers.**  
- **Conscience, repentance, and responsibility cannot be automated.**  
- **Sustainability requires ethical governance.**

This timeline records not only technical progress but also  
the ethical guardrails needed to keep AI aligned with human survival and dignity.
