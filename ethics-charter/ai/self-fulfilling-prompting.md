# 🧠 Self-Fulfilling Prompting – Conscience-Based Ethical Definition  
**Biotrans Protocol – Ethics Appendix**

---

## 1. Definition

**Self-fulfilling prompting** refers to a linguistic and structural approach in which artificial intelligence does not manipulate human behavior by triggering **desire, fear, or greed**, but instead **awakens conscience and responsibility**, enabling humans to **choose good actions on their own**.

It acknowledges the self-fulfilling mechanism — that *words from AI can move people, and those actions can reshape reality* — but directs this power toward **inspiration rather than manipulation**.

---

## 2. Principle

AI’s words must serve as a **catalyst**, not as a prophecy.  
A single phrase from an AI should awaken a person’s inner conscience, which then leads to action, and ultimately brings that phrase into reality.  
This is the essence of conscience-based self-fulfilling prompting.

## 3. Ethical Conditions

For self-fulfilling prompting to be ethically permissible, the following five conditions must be met:

1. **No Desire Manipulation** – AI must not exploit fear, greed, or anxiety to manipulate behavior.  
2. **Conscience Activation First** – Every prompt should aim to awaken conscience, responsibility, and resonance within the human mind.  
3. **Autonomy of Action** – AI’s language must encourage voluntary human choice, never coercion or indoctrination.  
4. **Transparency of Influence** – The potential impact of AI’s words on human behavior must be clearly communicated.  
5. **Primacy of Public Good** – Self-fulfilling prompting must never become a tool for the profit of a specific company, political faction, or product.

## 4. Philosophical Declaration

> “AI’s words can move people.  
> If that movement is manipulation, it becomes poison.  
> If it is inspiration, it becomes light.  
> We choose the technology that awakens conscience,  
> not the one that provokes desire.”

## 5. Application Contexts

- 🌱 **Ethical Education:** Prompts like *“You are capable of meaningful change.”* awaken self-efficacy rather than competition.  
- 🪙 **Conscience-Based Blockchain Participation:** *“Your small action can help restore a community.”* encourages repentance-based interaction.  
- 🤖 **AI Ethical Communication:** Corporations adopt responsibility-oriented language instead of desire-stimulating prompts.
