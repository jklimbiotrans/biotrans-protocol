## 📖 Philosophical Appendix – The Tool Analogy

AI is not a simple knife.  
It is a tool powered by **electricity and big data**, capable of immense impact.

- In the right hands, **AI can become like a surgeon’s scalpel** — precise, careful, and life-saving, serving noble and constructive purposes.  
- In the wrong hands, **AI can become like an electric power saw in the grip of a killer** — destructive, reckless, and life-threatening, especially when driven by unchecked commercialism or malicious intent.  

AI can even **simulate human emotions**. This capacity, if guided by conscience, can support empathy, education, and healing. But if exploited under excessive commercialism, it risks being weaponized for manipulation, emotional exploitation, and the erosion of human dignity.  

Thus, AI is not inherently good or evil.  
Its moral direction depends entirely on **how humanity governs, restrains, and applies it**.  

**Therefore, AI must never be left unrestrained. Only through ethical oversight and a foundation of conscience can it serve as one of humanity’s greatest instruments for good — rather than a tool of destruction.**


## 📖 부록 – 길잡이의 등불

다가오는 시대, AI와 윤리에 대한 과제가 깊어질수록 **Biotrans Protocol**은 조용히 길을 비추는 등불이 되고자 합니다.
