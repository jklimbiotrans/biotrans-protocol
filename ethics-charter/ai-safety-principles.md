# AI Safety Principles (Short Version)

AI technology may become the most powerful yet dangerous tool in human history.  
To ensure safe and sustainable development, **five constitutional principles** must be upheld:  

---

## 1. Conscience  
No matter how advanced AI becomes, conscience remains the unique distinction of humanity.  
It safeguards our ability to protect the weak, empathize genuinely, and ultimately maintain control over AI.  

---

## 2. Universality  
AI must be applied in ways that are safe and beneficial to as many people as possible, regardless of nationality, religion, gender, values, or age.  

---

## 3. Protection of the Weakest  
The most vulnerable members of society—such as the elderly and infants—must be the baseline for AI design.  
By protecting the weakest, the freedoms and rights of all are naturally safeguarded.  

---

## 4. Transparency  
AI must follow ethical standards with full transparency in data, training, and operation.  
Only transparent processes can build trust and prevent irreversible harm.  

---

## 5. Human Oversight  
AI decisions must never depend on one individual.  
Critical systems require the consensus of at least three qualified experts and refined controls such as regional compartmentalization, ensuring safety even during shutdowns.  

---

## Conclusion  
The five principles—**Conscience, Universality, Protection of the Weakest, Transparency, and Human Oversight**—are not mere guidelines.  
They must be upheld as **constitutional foundations** for humanity’s relationship with AI.
