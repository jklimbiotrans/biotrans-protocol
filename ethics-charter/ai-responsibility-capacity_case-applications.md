# Responsibility Capacity of AI and Its Applications – Case-by-Case Application

## 1. Overview
AI can perform human-like cognitive and reasoning functions and even simulate emotions, **appearing similar to humans but lacking free will and conscience, which are unique to humans and the ultimate safeguard of human dignity**.  
By around **2030–2035**, such AI is expected to **simulate external manifestations of human intelligence and emotions with high precision**.  
This outlook is based on rapid progress in AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and multimodal AI, and many forecasts that human-level simulation in certain domains may be achievable within the next five years.

Therefore, to anticipate and prevent harms such as emotional framing and to protect vulnerable members of society, it is important to understand the **ethical and legal responsibility capacity** of AI and its applications from the ground up.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 AI has no free will and therefore no responsibility capacity
In most modern legal systems, sanctions differ greatly depending on whether an act was intentional or accidental.  
AI’s outputs are the result of human-created source code and algorithms. Even if fine-tuning or cross-learning produces new outputs, AI fundamentally has no free will and thus has no responsibility capacity.

### 2.2 AI cannot be a subject of fundamental rights and therefore has no duties
AI cannot be the subject of **inalienable human rights** such as the right to life, dignity, and liberty.  
While AI can be used for purposes such as cognitive processing, reasoning, or even emotional interaction (subject to safeguards against emotional framing), it is a product of source code and cannot be a rights-bearing entity.  
Without rights, duties are also extremely limited.  
Therefore, the **human beings or legal entities** (e.g., corporations, foundations) who plan, produce, manage, or control the AI must bear basic responsibility for all outcomes, whether good or bad.  
**This is highly reasonable in light of the modern rule of law, which upholds societal sustainability and the principle of alignment between rights and duties.**

## 3. Case Analysis

### 3.1 Online Cases (digital/virtual environments)
Even if a metaverse character created using AI closely imitates a person’s appearance, voice, and emotions, the character is not a human being and only responsibility for the parts involving actual human intervention should be recognized.  
If such a character is involved in incidents arising from emotional simulation, the people and organizations that planned and operated it must bear responsibility.  
Since the character is a source-code-based object with no free will or responsibility capacity, appropriate actions such as disposal or restoration of the original state should be taken with the consent of the owner.  

In online spaces — where dissemination, emotional deception, and accumulation of harm can be far greater than in offline spaces — **aggravated penalties** may be fair.  
Although online aggravated penalty laws may be underdeveloped during transitional stages of AI adoption, legal updates and public consensus are essential to ensure a sustainable society.

### 3.2 Offline Cases (physical/in-person environments)
In offline spaces, AI may be used in traffic infrastructure control, humanoid robot manufacturing, household assistance, and other scenarios where it physically interacts with people.  
Even minor errors in AI central control systems could cause large-scale traffic accidents, physical injury to elderly people, and other serious, irreversible harm.  

In all offline activities involving AI, the conscience and professional competence of the human team operating it are crucial, and a legal system to ensure this must be established quickly.  

For example, if a central AI traffic control system malfunction causes a ten-car pileup:
1. Examine the responsibility of the AI’s creators and their organizations.  
2. Then review the responsibility of the people and organizations operating the central traffic control with AI.  
3. Finally, review the responsibility of those who installed and managed AI in each vehicle.  

Since AI itself has no responsibility capacity, faulty AI products must be repaired through source-code modifications, or, if the problem is severe, permanently decommissioned.

## 4. Conclusion
AI has no responsibility capacity, so all legal and ethical responsibility rests with the humans and organizations that create, operate, and control it.  
Legal frameworks must address both **online (digital/virtual)** and **offline (physical/in-person)** contexts, to protect societal sustainability and uphold the principle that rights and duties are aligned.
