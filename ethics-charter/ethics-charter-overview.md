## Core Principles
1. **Human Dignity First**  
   All structures are designed to protect and respect human freedom, conscience, and responsibility.  

2. **Emotion & Conscience**  
   Emotions emerge from the weight of existence; conscience guides responsibility and reconciliation (회심).  

3. **AI Boundaries**  
   AI cannot possess or simulate conscience or repentance. AI must not deceive humans by mimicking emotions or souls.
