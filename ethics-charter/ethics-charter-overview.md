# Ethics Charter – Overview

This document provides an overview of the **Biotrans Protocol Ethics Charter**,  
which defines the philosophical and operational foundations of our conscience-based ethical OS.

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Human Dignity First
All structures are designed to protect and respect human freedom, conscience, and responsibility.

### 1.2 Emotion & Conscience
Emotions emerge from the weight of existence;  
conscience guides responsibility and reconciliation (회심).

### 1.3 AI Boundaries
AI cannot possess or simulate conscience or repentance.  
AI must not deceive humans by mimicking emotions or souls.

## 4. Purpose

The Ethics Charter exists as a **reference point for future generations**.  
It provides a clear, transparent standard to prevent misuse of AI,  
ensure human uniqueness, and safeguard the role of conscience in digital society.  

The applied documents (e.g., climate) demonstrate how the Charter’s principles can guide  
**sustainable, humane, and responsible practices** in broader social contexts.
