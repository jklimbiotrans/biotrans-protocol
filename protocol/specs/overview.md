## 1. Purpose
Biotrans Protocol is a **conscience-based ethical protocol** designed to record, recognize, and encourage prosocial actions.  
Its goal is to create a digital environment where **trust, forgiveness, and moral choice** are structurally preserved.

---

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Conscience First** – The highest value is human conscience, not efficiency or control.  
2. **Voluntary Participation** – All engagement is strictly opt-in, with no forced linkage to rights, credit, or property.  
3. **Forgiveness & Redemption** – Wrongdoings can be reconciled through repentance and good deeds, ensuring no permanent exclusion.  
4. **Diversity of Resonance** – Recognition of goodness requires validation from multiple, diverse perspectives.  
5. **Transparency of Rules** – The ethical logic is open and publicly auditable, while individual data remains private.

## 3. Key Concepts

### 3.1 Moment of Truth (공명의 순간)
- A prosocial act is validated when **multiple independent observers** recognize it at the same time.  
- This **simultaneous resonance** ensures that recognition is not staged or manipulated.  
- Example: Three people witnessing someone helping a stranger and acknowledging it together.

### 3.2 Merit Points (善點, Goodness Tokens)
- When a valid resonance occurs, the actor receives **Merit Points**.  
- Merit is **non-transferable** and attached to the individual as a record of goodwill.  
- Accumulated merit may symbolically represent a life of conscience and repeated goodness.

### 3.3 Forgiveness & Reset
- Negative records (demerits) are not permanent.  
- They can be erased when:  
  - A person demonstrates consistent goodness beyond a threshold, or  
  - Another person grants forgiveness.  
- Forgiveness itself grants merit to the forgiver, reinforcing the culture of grace.

---

## 4. Privacy Model
- **Default: All personal scores remain private.**  
- **Selective Disclosure:** Individuals may voluntarily share proof of having merit without revealing totals (e.g., range proofs).  
- **Separation of Layers:**  
  - On-chain: minimal, tamper-proof proofs (hashes, timestamps).  
  - Off-chain: encrypted or distributed storage of detailed records.

---

## 5. Governance & Integrity
- Protocol changes require **time-locked governance** to avoid hasty or manipulative edits.  
- No central authority; governance may be DAO-based, but always minimal.  
- Reset cycles (e.g., 33, 77, 111 years) ensure long-term renewal and prevent accumulation of unjust power.

---

## 6. Ethical Boundaries
- **Not a currency** – Merit cannot be traded or used as money.  
- **Not a credit system** – Merit must never determine rights, property, or survival.  
- **Not surveillance** – No hidden monitoring; all recognition must come from voluntary, conscious human acknowledgment.  

---

## 7. Status
- Version: **v0.1 Draft**  
- Repository: `biotrans-protocol/protocol/specs/overview.md`  
- This is a **public philosophical specification**.  
- **Detailed formulas, parameters, and code remain in a private repository.**
