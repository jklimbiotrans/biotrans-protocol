# **Biotrans Protocol — Finance Module**
### *Ethics-Driven Financial Integrity Layers (v0.1)*

The Finance Module defines how the Biotrans Protocol integrates with traditional financial infrastructures without modifying legacy systems.  
It introduces a **three-layer ethical and verification stack** that brings transparency, fairness, and human recoverability to financial data.

This module operates *above* legacy financial cores (Layer 0) and provides a secure, privacy-preserving framework for consistent and ethical evaluation.

---

## **📚 Layer Overview**

The Finance module is composed of three conceptual layers:

---

## **🔹 Layer 1 — Event Mirror Layer**
**File:** `spec-layer1-event-mirror.md`  
Provides a tamper-resistant, privacy-preserving mirror of financial events.

- Mirrors approvals, settlements, corrections, and delinquency states  
- Stores only **EventHash**, **EventSummary**, **EventProof**  
- No PII or transaction data ever stored  
- Enables cross-layer consistency checks  
- Foundation for ethical verification  

---

## **🔹 Layer 2 — Ethics Verification Layer**
**File:** `spec-layer2-ethics-verification.md`  
Applies fairness, anti-bias logic, and forgiveness-based recovery.

- Detects inconsistencies and misclassifications  
- Enforces **DiversityProof** for unbiased evaluations  
- Implements forgiveness & long-term behavioral recovery  
- Ensures ethical and human-centered trust scoring  

---

## **🔹 Layer 3 — User Trust Dashboard**
**File:** `spec-layer3-trust-dashboard.md`  
Human-facing transparency and trust visualization.

- Shows corrected timelines and ZK-verified states  
- Displays SBT-based trust progression  
- Provides user-owned, privacy-preserving reputation signals  
- Optional opt-in public trust profile  
- Converts complex verification into simple human information  

---

## **📌 Architectural Principle**

The Finance Module follows a **hybrid architecture**:

1. **Do not modify legacy financial core systems** (Layer 0)  
2. **Mirror events safely** (Layer 1)  
3. **Evaluate ethically** (Layer 2)  
4. **Visualize transparently** (Layer 3)  

This structure ensures:

- integrity without intrusion  
- verification without exposure  
- fairness without bias  
- recoverability without stigma  
- transparency without revealing sensitive data  

---

## **🔐 Privacy & Security Philosophy**

- No raw transaction data is ever stored  
- No PII is ever processed  
- All verification is ZK-backed  
- Corrections and fairness rules are transparent  
- Implementation details remain internal for safety  

The Finance Module protects both **the user** and **the financial institution**, creating a future-ready ethical layer above legacy systems.

---

## **📈 Version**

- **Current Version:** v0.1  
- Future updates will expand:  
  - cross-institution interoperability  
  - advanced recovery logic  
  - ZK circuit enhancements  
  - DAO governance integration  

---

## **✔ Summary**

The Biotrans Finance Module provides an ethical, verifiable, privacy-respecting layer for the future of financial systems.  
It ensures fairness, transparency, and trust in an era where legacy infrastructures cannot be replaced but must be improved.

This module forms one of the core pillars of Biotrans Protocol’s **Ethics OS**.
