# **Biotrans Protocol — Layer 3 Specification**
## **User Trust Dashboard (Public Specification)**
### *Human-Centered Transparency and Ethical Visualization Layer*

---

## **1. Purpose of the User Trust Dashboard**

The Layer 3 User Trust Dashboard provides a **clear, human-readable interface** that displays the verified, ethically processed results from Layer 2.

Its purpose is to:

- present corrected and verified financial states  
- show trust/merit progression transparently  
- allow users to understand event timelines without confusion  
- offer optional reputation-sharing through non-transferable trust artifacts  

Layer 3 is the **human interface** of the Biotrans financial integration stack.

---

## **2. Core Functions of Layer 3**

Layer 3 focuses on presenting only **interpreted, validated, non-sensitive information**.

### **(1) Verified Transaction Timeline**
Displays:

- approval → settlement → correction chain  
- event timestamps  
- corrected or reclassified status (if Layer 2 adjusted anything)  
- ZK-verified markers indicating data integrity  

This solves the traditional “UI confusion” problems seen in legacy banking systems.

---

### **(2) Trust & Merit Visualization (SBT-Based)**

Shows the user’s:

- merit accumulation  
- forgiveness-triggered restorations  
- long-term behavioral consistency  
- DiversityProof-backed fairness indicators  

All trust signals are:

- **non-transferable**
- **user-owned**
- **privacy-preserving**

The dashboard does not reveal raw financial data or personal identifiers.

---

### **(3) Dispute & Correction Transparency**

Users can see:

- what was corrected  
- why it was corrected  
- what proof validated the correction  
- whether forgiveness or diversity logic played a role  

This provides cryptographic clarity and prevents unfair or opaque classification.

---

### **(4) Optional Public Profile (Opt-In Only)**

Users may choose to publish a summarized trust profile:

- merit trajectory  
- long-term behavioral stability  
- history of verified corrections  
- DiversityProof-backed fairness metrics  

All data is anonymized unless the user explicitly chooses otherwise.

This is useful for:

- decentralized credit  
- peer-to-peer credential sharing  
- DAO participation  
- reputation-based systems

---

## **3. Data Received by Layer 3**

Layer 3 receives only **interpreted outputs** from Layer 2:

- Verified event sequences  
- Corrected classifications  
- SBT trust signals  
- Forgiveness/merit adjustments  
- ZK-proof results  

It **never** receives:

- raw transaction amounts  
- merchant names  
- PII  
- financial institution data fields  

This ensures maximum privacy while maintaining transparency.

---

## **4. Public Modules in Layer 3**

### **TimelineModule**
Renders event chains and their corrected state.

### **TrustModule**
Displays SBT trust signals and behavioral progression.

### **CorrectionModule**
Shows verified corrections with explanations.

### **ProfileModule**
For optional opt-in public trust profiles.

Each module is visible to the user but does not expose sensitive data.

---

## **5. Guarantees Provided by Layer 3**

### ✔ **Human Clarity**
Users finally understand their financial status without legacy UI confusion.

### ✔ **Ethical Transparency**
All corrections and evaluations are explained and cryptographically verified.

### ✔ **Privacy Preservation**
Only non-sensitive, processed outputs are shown.

### ✔ **User Ownership**
Trust signals (SBTs) belong entirely to the user.

### ✔ **Control & Consent**
Public exposure is never automatic and always opt-in.

Layer 3 ensures that users remain in control of their ethical and financial identity.

---

## **6. Non-Public/Internal Elements**

Not disclosed:

- UI implementation details  
- styling, front-end frameworks  
- API endpoints  
- state management structures  
- internal logging rules  

Only conceptual behavior is made public.

---

## **7. Summary**

The User Trust Dashboard (Layer 3) is the **human-facing, transparent interface** of the Biotrans Protocol.  
It provides:

- clear visualized event histories  
- fairness-backed trust scoring  
- privacy-protected transparency  
- cryptographically verified corrections  
- user-controlled reputation options  

Layer 3 transforms abstract verification logic into **empathetic, understandable human information**, completing the top layer of the financial integrity framework.
