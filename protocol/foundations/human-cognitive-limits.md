# Human Cognitive Limits and Ethical Responsibility

## Purpose

This document defines biological and cognitive conditions
under which human judgment may be temporarily impaired.

These conditions are **foundational assumptions** for
ethical responsibility and system design within the Biotrans Protocol.

This framework is **not** a liability escape mechanism.
It exists to prevent misclassification of responsibility,
not to eliminate it.

## Core Principle

Being conscious does not guarantee rational agency.

Ethical responsibility presupposes
a brain state capable of reflection,
inhibition, and foresight.
This condition is not continuously satisfied.

## Impaired Judgment States (Illustrative, Not Exhaustive)

Temporary impairment may occur during various conditions.
Sleep-related states are one example, not the definition.

| Category | Example | Nature | Voluntary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transitional | Sleep inertia after waking | Temporary | No |
| Physiological | Acute illness, hypoglycemia | Temporary | No |
| Neurological | Sudden shock or disruption | Temporary | No |
| Chemical | Alcohol or drug intoxication | Temporary | Yes |
| Structural | Extreme fatigue imposed by system | Temporary | Mixed |

## Example: Sleep Inertia

Sleep inertia refers to a post-awakening state
in which executive cognitive functions
remain partially suppressed.

Typical features include:
- Reduced prefrontal cortical activity
- Increased reliance on habitual or emotional responses
- Distorted risk–reward evaluation

This state usually resolves within 30–90 minutes.

Sleep inertia is **one illustrative case**,
not a special exemption category.

## Responsibility Is Not Removed

Cognitive limitation does **not** remove responsibility.

It modifies **how responsibility is classified and applied**.

## Responsibility Classification

| Responsibility Type | Description | Affected by Impairment |
|---|---|---|
| Outcome Responsibility | Harm or impact caused by the action | No |
| Moral Judgment Responsibility | Intent and quality of ethical reasoning | Yes (limited) |
| Structural Responsibility | System conditions enabling the action | Increases |

Outcome responsibility is never voided.

## Voluntary vs Non-Voluntary Impairment

The protocol draws a strict boundary
between impairment types.

| Impairment Type | Ethical Treatment |
|---|---|
| Non-voluntary (e.g. sleep inertia, medical events) | Limit permanent ethical scoring |
| Voluntary (e.g. alcohol, drugs) | No mitigation permitted |
| Structurally imposed (e.g. forced exhaustion) | Shift responsibility toward system |

Voluntarily induced impairment
cannot be invoked to escape accountability.

## Protocol-Level Implication

Ethical responsibility within the Biotrans Protocol
is **conditional but non-optional**.

Systems assigning merit, fault, or consequence
must distinguish between:
- constrained judgment states
- fully reflective moral agency

Failure to do so constitutes a structural ethical error.

## Conclusion

Recognizing cognitive limits
does not weaken ethics.

It prevents ethical systems
from becoming inaccurate,
punitive,
or exploitable.
