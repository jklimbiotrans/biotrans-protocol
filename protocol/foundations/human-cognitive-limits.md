# Human Cognitive Limits and Ethical Responsibility

## Purpose

This document defines biological and cognitive constraints
under which human judgment is temporarily impaired.

These constraints are foundational assumptions
for ethical responsibility, governance design,
and AI–human boundary definitions within the Biotrans Protocol.

## Core Premise

Being awake does not imply being rational.

Human ethical responsibility presupposes
a sufficiently active prefrontal cortex.
This condition is not met immediately after awakening.

## Sleep Inertia

### Definition

Sleep inertia refers to a transitional neurobiological state
occurring after awakening,
during which cognitive performance remains degraded.

### Characteristics

During sleep inertia:
- Cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex remains reduced
- Glucose metabolism supporting executive function is suppressed
- Reaction time, inhibition, and reflective reasoning are impaired

This state typically lasts between 30 and 90 minutes,
and may extend longer depending on sleep debt and circadian disruption.

## Subcortical Dominance

While the prefrontal cortex is underactive,
decision-making is disproportionately driven by subcortical systems.

- The basal ganglia favor habitual and automated responses
- The amygdala amplifies threat detection and loss aversion

As a result, judgments tend toward
immediate avoidance, risk aversion, and impulsive correction,
rather than reflective evaluation.

## Neurochemical Transition Lag

Upon awakening:
- Residual adenosine continues to suppress cortical activity
- Cortisol rises sharply, increasing arousal without stability
- Dopaminergic signaling remains temporarily imbalanced

This neurochemical mismatch distorts risk–reward assessment
and amplifies emotional weighting.

## Ethical Implications

Decisions made during early post-awakening periods
should not be interpreted as representative of:
- stable personal values
- long-term ethical orientation
- full rational agency

Any ethical, financial, or computational system
that evaluates or records human decisions
must account for biological states
in which rational responsibility is partially impaired.

## Protocol-Level Implication

The Biotrans Protocol recognizes
that ethical responsibility is conditional,
not continuous.

Systems that assign merit, fault, or consequence
must distinguish between:
- biologically constrained judgment states
- fully reflective moral agency

Ignoring this distinction
constitutes a structural ethical error.

## Conclusion

Human rational responsibility
requires more than consciousness.

It requires a brain state
capable of reflection, inhibition, and accountability.

This biological constraint
is not a weakness of ethics,
but a boundary condition for its validity.
