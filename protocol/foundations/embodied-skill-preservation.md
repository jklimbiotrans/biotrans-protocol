# Principle of Skill Preservation  
*(Embodied Skill Preservation)*

This document defines a **foundational protocol principle** for preserving
human expertise and judgment across generations.

It is **not an implementation specification**.

This principle builds upon the assumptions defined in  
`human-cognitive-limits.md`, particularly the **structural limits of human cognition**.

---

## 1. Premise: Human cognition is not a reliable long-term storage for skill

Humans are capable of high-level judgment and expertise,  
but **human cognition is structurally fragile as a long-term storage medium**.

- Expertise is tightly coupled to an individual’s brain, senses, and bodily responses
- It cannot be fully transferred through documentation or manuals
- It is lost through retirement, death, or organizational exit

This is not a personal failure.  
It is a **structural limitation of human cognition**.

---

## 2. A recurring historical failure: the loss of expertise

Human history repeatedly demonstrates the same pattern.

- The disappearance of Roman concrete technology
- Collapse of craft-based industries
- Loss of specialized surgical techniques
- Fragility of production systems dependent on specific individuals

The common cause is clear:

> **Expertise was stored only in people.**

---

## 3. Misguided solution paths

Common intuitive responses to skill loss include:

- Retaining exceptional individuals indefinitely
- Attempting to replicate or store the human brain itself
- Relying on lineage-based or mentor-centered transmission

These approaches are not sustainable.

- Technically unverifiable
- Ethically and legally ambiguous
- Non-reproducible and non-scalable

**Preserving the human itself is not a viable solution.**

---

## 4. Core transition: relocating the locus of expertise

This protocol defines a single fundamental transition.

> Expertise should not be removed from humans,  
> but **relocated from human embodiment to systems via human-mediated traces**.

In other words:

- Humans are not copied
- Decisions and actions are recorded
- Systems, not individuals, become the memory layer

---

## 5. Principle of human-mediated skill logging

High-level expertise can be preserved through the following structure:

1. Experts perform tasks **through machines, robots, or controlled systems**
2. During operation, the following elements are recorded:
   - Fine-grained motion vectors
   - Force and velocity modulation
   - Timing of pauses, detours, and recoveries
   - Failure avoidance and correction patterns
3. Data is stored **by task type and contextual condition**

Within this structure:

- Humans remain the **source of judgment**
- Systems become the **agents of memory and reproduction**

---

## 6. The constrained role of AI

Within this protocol, AI is limited to the following functions:

- Generalizing expert operation logs
- Extracting condition-dependent patterns
- Reproducing behavior consistently under equivalent conditions

AI is **not**:

- An autonomous moral agent
- A final authority on value-based decisions

---

## 7. Residual human responsibilities

This principle does not eliminate humans.  
Instead, it **clarifies and concentrates human responsibility**.

Humans retain responsibility for:

- Value judgment
- Ethical boundary setting
- Final accountability in exceptional cases
- System design, oversight, and correction

As expertise moves into systems:

> **The number of humans decreases,  
> while the abstraction level and responsibility per human increase.**

---

## 8. Applicable domains

This principle is domain-agnostic.

Applicable examples include:

- Semiconductor manufacturing processes
- High-precision surgical procedures (e.g., ophthalmology, neurosurgery)
- Aerospace and aviation systems
- High-risk industrial control environments

Common conditions include:

- High cost of failure
- Repetitive execution
- Significant tacit knowledge components

---

## 9. Conclusion

A system where expertise disappears with individuals is  
not merely inefficient — it is **dangerous**.

This principle aims to:

- Prevent generational loss of expertise
- Ensure reproducibility and scalability of critical skills
- Maintain clear human accountability

> Do not attempt to preserve the genius.  
> **Preserve the trace of the genius’s judgment.**

This is the core principle of embodied skill preservation.
