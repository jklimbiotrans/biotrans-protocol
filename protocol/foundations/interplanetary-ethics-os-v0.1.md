# Biotrans Interplanetary Ethics OS v0.1  
_A minimal ethical foundation for multi-planetary human–AI–robot coexistence_  

Status: **Draft**

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines a minimal set of ethical rules (“Interplanetary Ethics OS”)  
for futures where:

- humans live and work across multiple habitats (Earth, Moon, Mars, orbital stations),  
- AI systems and robots operate as persistent infrastructure,  
- resource extraction and energy systems are extended beyond Earth.

It is **not** a technical spec for rockets, navigation, or military use.  
It is a **normative foundation** for later specs, governance rules, and soft-system design.

## 2. Design Assumptions

1. Human life, consciousness, and emotion remain the primary subject of protection.  
2. AI and robots do not possess “repentance” or “emotion”; they only simulate patterns.  
3. Extreme environments (space habitats) amplify conflict risk and coordination failures.  
4. Resource and energy systems will be unevenly distributed across habitats.  
5. Ethical OS must survive at least one century of regime and technology change.

This foundation extends the existing Biotrans Protocol work on:

- Emotion OS and neuro model  
- Ethical OS transition roadmap (2025–2037)  
- Merit / demerit, repentance, and forgiveness mechanisms

## 3. Core Rules (v0.1)

### 3.1 Primacy of Life and Consciousness

- All systems shall prioritize the protection of human life and conscious beings.  
- AI and robots must not autonomously choose trade-offs that sacrifice life  
  for efficiency, profit, or political objectives.

### 3.2 Autonomy and Non-Coercion

- Human free will remains the highest authority in personal decisions.  
- AI and infrastructure systems must not manipulate, coerce, or nudge individuals  
  into irreversible choices without explicit, informed consent.  

### 3.3 Fairness in Extra-Planetary Resources

- Resources extracted from the Moon, asteroids, or other bodies must not be governed  
  solely by “first possession” or “force”.  
- Access and benefit sharing should be monitored by multi-party, verifiable systems  
  (e.g., transparent ledgers, diversity-proof governance).

### 3.4 Repentance and Forgiveness Mechanism

- In closed habitats, conflicts are inevitable; permanent condemnation is unsustainable.  
- Demerits are not publicly broadcast by default and are designed to be **erasable**  
  when genuine repentance is demonstrated.  
- Forgiveness events trigger partial or full erasure of demerits and positive updates  
  to both sides’ ethical state (mutual moral growth).

### 3.5 Boundaries for AI Behaviour

- AI must not simulate emotions for the purpose of deception, addiction, or dependency.  
- Emotion-like interaction with vulnerable groups (children, elderly, psychologically fragile)  
  must be restricted or strictly supervised.  
- AI decision paths must be auditable; responsibility rests with human designers and operators.

### 3.6 Inter-Habitat Synchronization

- Habitats (stations, colonies, bases) should maintain minimal synchronization across:  
  time standards, critical alerts, and safety protocols.  
- Severe incidents (environmental failure, abuse of power, systemic discrimination)  
  must be shareable across habitats in a privacy-preserving but tamper-resistant way.

### 3.7 Preservation of Emotion and Conscience

- Emotion and conscience are treated as non-transferable human capacities,  
  never as a credit score or survival condition.  
- No habitat or system may tie basic rights or survival access to emotion scores.  
- Emotional and ethical data must not be used as a tool for political or commercial domination.

## 4. Relation to Biotrans Protocol

Interplanetary Ethics OS is:

- a **foundation layer** above the Biotrans Emotion OS and ethical blockchain concepts,  
- future-compatible with merit / demerit, repentance, and forgiveness structures,  
- designed to be referenced by later specs (e.g., “space-habitat-governance-v0.x”).  

It does **not** define token mechanics, governance tokens, or financial instruments.  
Those, if any, must strictly obey the core rules in Section 3.

---

## 5. Roadmap

Future versions may include:

- alignment with interplanetary networking standards (DTN, space internet),  
- concrete interfaces for logging ethical events across habitats,  
- simulation testbeds for forgiveness and conflict-recovery dynamics,  
- mappings to existing Biotrans Protocol specs (merit SBT, diversity proof, etc.).

v0.1 is intentionally minimal:  
it exists to mark an ethical anchor **before** technical and political interests  
capture the standards for space.
