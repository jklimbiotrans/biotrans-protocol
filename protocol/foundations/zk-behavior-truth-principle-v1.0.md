# ZK Behavior Truth Principle v1.0  
### Biotrans Protocol — Foundations

## Description
This foundational document defines the principle that the Biotrans Protocol
does **not** measure conscience or inner states, but **may verify the truthfulness of observable actions** through privacy-preserving, zero-knowledge mechanisms.  
It establishes the boundary between *inner inviolability* and *behavioral truth verification*, ensuring that only action-based, non-intrusive validation is allowed within the Protocol.

---

## 1. Core Principle
The Protocol **cannot** access, infer, or evaluate any person’s inner state, emotion, motive, or conscience.  
However, the Protocol **may validate the factual truth or falsehood** of externally observable behavior using cryptographic, decentralized, and privacy-safe methods.

---

## 2. Truth Verification Scope
Allowed:
- Verification of whether an action **actually occurred**
- Detection of **behavior-pattern contradictions**
- Cross-checking consistency of claims across diverse observers
- Longitudinal analysis of behavior repetition and stability
- Zero-knowledge confirmation of action records without identity exposure

Not allowed:
- Detecting motives, intentions, beliefs, emotions, or conscience
- Inferring inner states from biological signals, biometrics, or affective data
- Any algorithmic attempt to classify sincerity, morality, or character

---

## 3. Zero-Knowledge Framework Requirement
All permitted truth verification must:
1. Use **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** or equivalent privacy-preserving cryptography  
2. Avoid identity exposure  
3. Prevent behavioral manipulation  
4. Resist replay, forgery, and tampering  
5. Operate without accessing any form of inner-state data

This ensures that **truthful action validation** never becomes **inner-state intrusion**.

---

## 4. Accuracy Threshold for Activation
The Protocol shall only enable large-scale behavioral truth verification when:
- Cross-check accuracy across independent observers exceeds **80%**, and  
- False-positive risk for innocence remains **extremely low**

This threshold ensures the system never harms individuals through premature or unreliable inference.

---

## 5. Boundary with Conscience Non-Measurement
This principle must always be interpreted in harmony with the  
**Inviolability & Non-Measurability of Conscience** clause:

- Conscience is unmeasurable  
- Inner states are off-limits  
- Behavior is the only admissible domain of verification  

Thus, truth verification is **structurally limited** to the observable world.

---

## 6. Purpose
The purpose of this principle is to:
- Minimize deception and manipulation in decentralized systems  
- Support reliable cross-verification of actions without violating privacy  
- Provide a clean behavioral data layer for future ethical applications  
- Ensure the Protocol remains aligned with human dignity and autonomy  

---

## 7. Amendments
Future versions may refine cryptographic or procedural standards but  
**may never expand truth verification into inner-state inference.**
