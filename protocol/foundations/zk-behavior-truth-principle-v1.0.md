# ZK Behavior Truth Principle v1.0  
### Biotrans Protocol — Foundations Layer

## Description
This foundational document defines how the Biotrans Protocol may verify the **truthfulness of observable actions**—never inner states—using zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party cross-checking, and long-term behavioral pattern analysis.  
It establishes the boundary between **conscience non-measurement** and **permitted action-level validation**, ensuring privacy, dignity, and strict separation between inner life and external behavior.

---

## 1. Inviolability and Non-Measurability of Conscience
The Protocol must never access, infer, classify, or quantify:
- conscience  
- intention  
- belief  
- sincerity  
- emotion  
- motive  
- any inner psychological state  

These domains are fundamentally unmeasurable and belong exclusively to human dignity.

---

## 2. Domain of Permissible Verification: Observable Behavior
The Protocol may verify **truth or falsehood** strictly in the domain of observable actions through:
- confirmation of whether an action occurred (fact verification)
- detection of contradictions in behavioral patterns
- multi-party, diversity-based cross-checking
- long-term behavioral repetition analysis
- zero-knowledge proof-of-action without identity exposure

The Protocol evaluates behaviors, not minds.

---

## 3. Truth Without Sincerity Measurement
Sincerity and moral intent cannot be measured.  
Instead, the Protocol adheres to these principles:

- **truth is behavior-based**  
- **inner sincerity is not evaluated**  
- **repetition reveals reliability**  
- **cross-check diversity reduces bias**  

Truth verification remains external, factual, and non-intrusive.

## 4. Importance of Eliminating Deception
Removing deception—false claims, fabricated actions, manipulative presentation—substantially increases global cooperation and stability.  
The Protocol does not require measurement of inner morality;  
**reducing deception alone provides sufficient systemic benefit.**

---

## 5. Authorized Behavioral Truth-Verification Methods
Permitted (behavior-only, privacy-preserving):
1. Timestamp and sequence consistency checks  
2. Zero-knowledge proof-of-action (ZK-PoA)  
3. Decentralized multi-party factual cross-checking  
4. Behavioral graph contradiction detection  
5. Action–claim mismatch analysis  
6. Cross-cultural diversity verification  

Prohibited:
- emotional inference  
- biometric-based emotional analysis  
- affective-state modeling  
- motive or sincerity prediction  
- neural or physiological inference  
- any attempt to classify inner states  

---

## 6. Accuracy Threshold for Activation
Behavioral truth verification at scale requires:
- at least **80% cross-check accuracy** across independent observers  
- minimal false-positive risk  
- strong resistance to manipulation or forgery  

This ensures the Protocol never harms individuals through unreliable inference.

---

## 7. Boundary with Conscience Non-Measurement
This principle must always remain subordinate to the constitutional clause  
**Inviolability & Non-Measurability of Conscience**.  

Accordingly:
- inner states remain permanently inaccessible  
- truth verification is restricted to behavior only  
- ZK mechanisms ensure no identity or inner data is exposed  

---

## 8. Purpose
The purpose of this principle is to:
- eliminate deception without violating privacy  
- create a reliable behavioral evidence layer  
- support ethical applications grounded in human dignity  
- maintain strict separation between inner conscience and external behavior  
- ensure cryptographic truth without psychological intrusion  

---

## 9. Amendments
Future versions may refine procedural or cryptographic standards but may **never expand** verification into inner-state inference.
