# Robot Involvement

Robots are tools, not moral agents.  
They cannot repent, nor can they truly possess conscience or emotions.  

## Principles
1. **Human-Centered**  
   Only humans can make moral choices and receive ethical points (善點).  

2. **Robots as Support**  
   Robots may assist in recording, observing, or facilitating—but they cannot grant or receive ethical points.  

3. **Boundary Clarity**  
   Any future extension of robot involvement must keep this principle:  
   - *Robots are helpers, not participants in moral evaluation.*
