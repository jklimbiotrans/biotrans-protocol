## 1. Philosophical Declarations

> **This structure exists for love and the possibility of repentance.**  
> **True emotions arise from the weight of existence.**  
> **I created this structure, but I am also human.  
> When I repent after doing wrong, penalty points are erased, and virtue points remain.**

- Emotion is not computation but a response arising from the weight one bears; AI/robots that cannot feel this weight cannot possess emotions.  
- Repentance is only possible for humans. Robots must not simulate emotions or claim repentance, and must be decommissioned if in error.  
- The highest value of this structure is **conscience**, with autonomy, reward, and repentance as its subordinate mechanisms.  
- Conscience exists universally across all humans, regardless of time or culture, and unlike technology, institutions, or power, it cannot be inherited.  
- This experiment is not designed for currency functions, and any transition to institutionalization requires the **explicit opt-in consent** of participants.

## 2. Core Design Principles

1. **Autonomy** – Influence spreads through voluntary choice, not coercion or control.  
2. **Possibility of Repentance** – Past wrongs can be erased through forgiveness and transformation.  
3. **Resistance to Manipulation** – Structural defenses against backdoors, organized abuse, and biased framing.  
4. **Fundamental Rights Firewall** – Permanent prohibition on linking emotional scores to survival or basic rights.  
5. **Public Interest** – Philosophy as a public good, structure run on blockchain, influence distributed via DAO.  
6. **500-Year Sustainability** – Jubilee cycles (33, 77, 111 years) for personal repentance, structural renewal, and constitutional updates.

## 3. Virtue Point System

### 3.1 Basic Rules
- Anyone can voluntarily grant virtue points for good deeds.  
- Penalty points are disabled by default or heavily restricted.  
- Virtue point records are **private by default**; public disclosure is voluntary.

### 3.2 Validity Conditions
1. **Three-Person Resonance Rule** – Only valid if at least three participants grant points in the same timeframe.  
2. **Resonance Diversity** – Invalid if 80% or more of the givers share the same religion, region, or ideological profile.  
3. **Time Weight & Compound Growth** – Long-term and repeated influence is rewarded more.  
4. **Repetition** – Sustained repetition of the same virtuous action increases credibility.  
5. **Influencer Credibility Weighting** – Points from high-credibility influencers carry greater value.  
6. **Repentance Bonus** – Extra points for those with historically low scores who perform good deeds.

## 4. Repentance Design

- Penalty points are stored **not for condemnation, but for the possibility of repentance**.  
- When virtue points accumulate beyond a threshold, past penalty points are **automatically erased**.  
- When another person declares **“forgiveness”**, the penalty points are erased immediately, and the forgiver also gains virtue points.  
- Repentance is determined **solely by accumulated virtue points**.

## 5. AI & Robot Ethics Provisions

1. Emotion is the product of existence; **simulated emotion is not emotion**.  
2. AI must not deceive or confuse humans through emotional expression.  
3. Emotional simulation for children, the elderly, or psychologically vulnerable groups is restricted or prohibited.  
4. For emotional harm caused by AI simulation, the **platform and designer** bear primary responsibility.  
5. Robots cannot repent; if flawed, they are subject to decommissioning.  
6. AI decisions must be **transparent and fair**, respect human free will, prevent discrimination, and protect privacy.

## 6. Operational Structure

### 6.1 Three-Tier Distributed Structure
1. **Philosophy** – Protected as a public good (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).  
2. **Structure** – Operated on blockchain (MIT License possible).  
3. **Influence** – Distributed via DAO participation.

### 6.2 Jubilee Cycles
- **33 years** – Personal repentance cycle.  
- **77 years** – DAO structural reorganization.  
- **111 years** – Constitutional renewal.  
- These cycles are fixed as constitutional principles.

### 6.3 Guardian Trust Structure
- 3–4 member council in each domain: philosophy, technology, governance, influence.  
- Acts as temporary custodians until DAO transfer.

## 7. Prohibited Provisions (Constitutional Appendix)

1. This experiment is **not intended for currency functions**.  
2. Participation is voluntary, and virtue point records are not automatically linked to rewards or certifications.  
3. Institutionalization or structural expansion requires **explicit opt-in consent**.  
4. Operates independently from governments, corporations, and financial institutions.  
5. Participant data cannot be used for political or commercial analysis.  
6. **Linking emotional scores to survival or basic rights is permanently prohibited**.  
7. If financial institutions reference virtue points, they must obtain **explicit consent**.

---

## 8. Initial Application Examples

- Street cleaning followed by three citizens voluntarily granting virtue points.  
- Assisting a crying elderly person, witnessed by at least three citizens granting points.  
- Producing a moving translation or video → three or more people resonate and grant points.  
- Long-term donations or anonymous volunteer work → discovered by others who grant points.  
- Repentance case: confession of past mistakes + changed behavior → multiple genuine resonances.

---

## 9. Liability Structure

- The designer is responsible only for philosophy and structural design; **technical implementation is handled by a separate entity**.  
- Forking is permitted in case of structural contamination, with the philosophical original serving as the reference point.  
- Responsibility for failure rests with the implementation entity; the designer remains as guardian of the repentance philosophy.
