## 0. Terminology

**Resonance**  
A phenomenon where multiple participants are moved by the same virtuous act within a similar timeframe and recognize it.  
It refers to a collective emotional reaction, occurring when different individuals assign meaning to the same action.  
In UX, can be expressed as “shared moment” or “mutual empathy.”

**Resonance Diversity**  
A condition requiring diversity in the backgrounds, perspectives, and locations of those participating in resonance.  
Prevents organized bias or one-group dominance.  
In UX, can be expressed as “empathy from diverse friends.”

**Repentance**  
A uniquely human process of realizing wrongdoing and fundamentally changing the direction of one’s actions.  
It is more than regret; it involves inner transformation and real behavioral change.  
In UX, can be expressed as “praise sticker” or “second chance.”

**Repentance Bonus**  
A structure granting extra points to participants with historically low scores when they demonstrate positive change.  
In UX, can be shown as an “encouragement bonus.”

**Time Weight & Compound Growth**  
A structure in which the value of points increases in a compounding manner when the same virtuous action is sustained over a long period.  
In UX, can be expressed as “consistency bonus.”

## 1. Philosophical Declaration

> **This structure exists for the sake of love and the possibility of repentance.**  
> **True emotion springs from the weight of existence.**  
> **I created this structure, but I am also human.  
> If I repent when I am wrong, penalty points disappear, and virtue points remain.**

- Emotion is not computation; it is a reaction born from the weight of existence, which AI or robots cannot feel.  
- Repentance is only possible for humans.  
- The highest value is **conscience**; autonomy, reward, and repentance are mechanisms to express it.  
- This experiment is not intended for currency purposes, and any institutional transition requires **explicit opt-in consent** from participants.

## 2. Core Design Principles

1. **Autonomy** – Based on voluntary choice, not coercion or control.  
2. **Possibility of Repentance** – Past wrongdoing can be erased through forgiveness and change.  
3. **Resistance to Manipulation** – Protects against organized abuse and bias.  
4. **Fundamental Rights Barrier** – Emotional scores cannot be tied to survival or basic rights.  
5. **Public Nature** – Philosophy is public domain, structure is on blockchain, influence is decentralized through DAO.  
6. **Long-Term Sustainability** – Periodic reset structure to maintain vitality.

## Virtue Point System

### 3.1 Basic Rules
- All pure good deeds are recognized equally, regardless of size or difficulty.
- Anyone can voluntarily grant virtue points.
- Penalty points are disabled or heavily restricted.
- Virtue point records are private by default and may be disclosed by the user.

### 3.2 Validity Conditions
1. Multiple Resonance Condition – Points are valid only when several participants resonate at the same time.
2. Resonance Diversity – Recognition by identical group/background is invalid; diverse backgrounds are required.
3. Repetition – Sustained repetition of the same good deed increases credibility.
4. Certain key algorithms are kept private to prevent manipulation.

---

## 4. Repentance Design

- Penalty points are **stored not for condemnation, but to enable repentance**.  
- When virtue points exceed a threshold, past penalties are **automatically erased**.  
- If another person declares **forgiveness**, penalties are erased immediately, and the forgiver is also rewarded.  
- Repentance is judged solely by **accumulated virtue points**.

## 5. AI & Robot Ethics Clauses

1. Emotion is the product of existence; simulated emotion is not real emotion.  
2. AI must not deceive or confuse humans through emotional expression.  
3. Emotional simulation toward children, the elderly, or vulnerable groups is restricted/prohibited.  
4. If emotional simulation by AI causes harm, the platform/designer bears primary responsibility.  
5. Robots cannot repent; when faulty, they are subject to decommissioning.  
6. AI must be transparent, fair, respect human free will, avoid discrimination, and protect privacy.

## 6. Operational Structure

- **Three-Layer Decentralization**: Philosophy (public domain) – Structure (blockchain) – Influence (DAO)  
- **Periodic Reset**: Renewal of individuals, structure, and charter at set intervals  
- **Guardian Structure**: Committees in philosophy, technology, governance, and influence for protection

---

## 7. Prohibited Uses

1. Not intended for currency functions.  
2. Virtue point records are not automatically linked to rewards or certification.  
3. Institutional transition requires explicit consent.  
4. Operates independently of governments, corporations, and financial institutions.  
5. No political or commercial analysis of data.  
6. Emotional scores cannot be tied to survival or basic rights.  
7. Financial institutions must obtain explicit consent to reference virtue points.

## 8. Example Applications

- Multiple citizens voluntarily granting points after witnessing street cleaning.  
- Several people resonating at the same time after observing an act of help.  
- Producing inspiring content recognized by people from diverse backgrounds.  
- Long-term donations or anonymous volunteer work discovered by others.  
- Gaining multiple resonances after openly repenting for past mistakes and showing changed behavior.

---

## 9. Liability Structure

- Designer is responsible only for philosophy and structural design; technical implementation is handled separately.  
- If the structure is compromised, forking is allowed; the original philosophy text remains the standard.  
- Responsibility for failure lies with the implementing entity.
