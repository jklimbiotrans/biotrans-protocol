# ðŸ“˜ Biotrans Protocol â€“ Affective & Ethical Core Terminology (Foundational Version)

> This glossary provides foundational terminology for the affective-ethical layer of the Biotrans Protocol.  
> It is not a finalized specification but a **conceptual reference point** to guide future implementations, including blockchain systems, smart contracts, AI models, and data architectures.

## ðŸŒ± Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Repentance Event** | An ethical turning point where an individual recognizes a past wrong and demonstrates change through concrete actions. Repentance triggers an increase in merit points and enables partial deletion of previously recorded demerits. |
| **Moral Influence** | The positive transformative effect of a personâ€™s actions, words, or creations on othersâ€™ inner states. Influence can be measured through resonance responses within the network. |
| **Affective Resonance** | The process by which another personâ€™s emotions or ethical actions interact with oneâ€™s own emotional field, leading to inner transformation. Resonance becomes a valid basis for merit issuance only when diversity and simultaneity conditions are met. |
| **Merit Point** | A non-monetary unit granted when collective resonance occurs in response to an act of moral influence. Merit points accumulate with compound weight over time, quantifying oneâ€™s influence and trust level. |
| **Demerit Point** | A recorded score reflecting harmful or unethical actions. Demerits remain private by default and can be deleted through repentance or forgiveness. |
| **Forgiveness Action** | A voluntary declaration to forgive another personâ€™s past wrongdoing. Forgiveness immediately deletes the targetâ€™s relevant demerits and grants partial merit to the forgiver as well. |
| **Behavior Recurrence Index** | A metric measuring how consistently a specific type of moral behavior is repeated over time. Higher recurrence indicates greater reliability of influence. |
| **Diversity Resonance Condition** | A validity criterion requiring that the individuals granting merit points represent sufficiently diverse backgrounds (e.g., region, religion, worldview). This prevents organized abuse or manipulation. |
| **Influence Reflection Ratio** | A metric measuring how much a particular act of influence changes the behavior or choices of surrounding individuals. It serves as an objective indicator of structural impact. |
| **Temporal Compounding Weight** | A mechanism in which repeated moral actions gain increased weight over time, rewarding long-term sincerity and persistence. |
| **Self-Purification Loop** | A cyclical process in which an individual repeatedly engages in repentance and virtuous actions, gradually purifying past traces and forming a new basis of trust. |

## ðŸ“Œ Notice on Usage

This glossary is a **foundational version** designed to establish conceptual definitions and reference points for the Biotrans Protocol.  
It is not a finalized specification. Future implementations â€” including blockchain contracts, decentralized governance models, and AI-driven affective systems â€” **may extend, refine, or reinterpret** these terms according to technical requirements, legal frameworks, and societal consensus.  
This document serves as a **baseline reference** for such future work.
