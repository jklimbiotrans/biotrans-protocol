# The Risk of Selling Emotional Data and an Alternative

## 1. Background: Toward a Data Income Society
Around the 2030s, individuals may begin to **earn income by selling their personal data** — not only behavior and preferences, but also facial expressions, voice patterns, and even emotions.  
At first, this may look like a new source of basic income. But over time, people may have to **sell deeper layers of their private life** just to survive.

## 2. The Risk: Emotional Zombification
If human emotions are continuously commodified:
- People may lose the ability to act from **free will**.  
- Emotions may be reduced to **patterns optimized for sale**.  
- Human beings risk turning into **“emotional zombies”** — alive, but functioning as data-producing machines.  

This is not simply an economic risk, but a **civilizational risk**.

## 3. The Alternative: Biotrans Protocol
Biotrans Protocol proposes an **ethical experiment** that protects human dignity in the era of data commodification.  

Key principles:
1. **Repentance & Renewal** – Humans must always retain the possibility to change and begin anew.  
2. **Conscience First** – Conscience and free will come before data.  
3. **Voluntary Recognition** – Good deeds should be acknowledged through voluntary resonance, not forced scoring.  
4. **Transparency** – Records should be visible and verifiable, not monopolized by a single group.  
5. **Long-Term Continuity** – A structure that can endure beyond short-term trends, across generations.  

## 4. Purpose of the Experiment
- To **capture the pure moments of human goodness** before they disappear.  
- To ensure those moments are **shared transparently and spread across society**.  
- To create a cycle where **“free will → good deeds → resonance → positive feedback”** sustains communities.  

## 5. Declaration
> “This structure exists for love and the possibility of repentance.  
> Data should never dominate humanity.  
> Humanity’s conscience must lead data, not the other way around.”  

## 6. Prohibited Uses
1. This experiment is **not intended as a currency**.  
2. Recorded good deeds **do not automatically translate into income or status**.  
3. All participation is based on **explicit voluntary choice (Opt-in)**.  
4. Governments, corporations, or banks **must not use this protocol as a tool of control**.  

## 7. Expected Timeline (Illustrative)
- **~2030**: Data income systems expand, human autonomy begins to weaken.  
- **2032–2035**: Emotional zombification deepens, social polarization grows.  
- **Biotrans Protocol**: Introduced as an **ethical alternative** to preserve human dignity and freedom.
