# Reference Value Metric ‚Äì Measuring Commercial and Ethical Impact of Biotrans Protocol

## Overview

The **Reference Value Metric (RVM)** is a framework for measuring how much a product, service, or AI system draws upon the principles, structures, and philosophy of the **Biotrans Protocol**.  
Because Biotrans Protocol is not for sale and cannot be transferred as a proprietary asset, this metric provides a way to evaluate its **reference value** and establish fair terms for **royalties, partnerships, or co-credits** when it is used as a foundation for commercial or educational projects.

This document defines how to assess the depth, scope, and ethical alignment of external systems referencing Biotrans Protocol, enabling transparent collaboration without compromising its public, conscience-based nature.

---

## 1. Purpose

- üìú **Preserve philosophical integrity:** Ensure that any derivative product respects the repentance- and conscience-based foundations of Biotrans Protocol.  
- üìà **Enable fair value recognition:** Quantify the extent to which a system relies on Biotrans principles and assign appropriate royalty or attribution terms.  
- ü§ù **Facilitate partnerships:** Provide a standard reference tool for negotiating collaboration between Biotrans-based systems and external developers, studios, or organizations.

---

## 2. Scoring Framework

Each project referencing Biotrans Protocol can be evaluated across four key dimensions. The total score ranges from **0 to 100**, indicating how deeply and faithfully the system engages with the protocol.

| Dimension | Description | Weight |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| üìö **Reference Depth** | How many core principles (repentance, conscience, forgiveness, diversity resonance, etc.) are implemented or cited. | 30% |
| üß¨ **Structural Dependency** | How much the system depends on Biotrans‚Äô original structures (Merit/Demerit logic, forgiveness burn, diversity proof, ethical OS). | 40% |
| üß† **Attribution & Branding** | Whether the product explicitly acknowledges Biotrans Protocol in documentation, UI, whitepapers, or governance. | 10% |
| üìà **Scale & Impact** | The scale of adoption, user base, or influence of the derivative product (e.g., user count, revenue, societal reach). | 20% |

üìä **RVM Score = Œ£ (Dimension √ó Weight)**  
Example: A product scoring 85+ is considered **High-Value Derivative**, while 50~70 is a **Partial Reference Implementation**.

## 3. Suggested Value Tiers

| RVM Score | Classification | Suggested Terms |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **90 ‚Äì 100** | Deep Reference (Full Alignment) | Co-credit, revenue share, potential DAO membership |
| **70 ‚Äì 89** | Major Reference | Attribution + royalty (1~5%) or joint partnership |
| **50 ‚Äì 69** | Partial Reference | Attribution required, optional royalty |
| **30 ‚Äì 49** | Minimal Reference | Attribution only |
| **< 30** | Peripheral | Acknowledgment recommended but not required |

These tiers are not legal mandates but serve as **guidelines** for fair collaboration and value recognition.

## 4. Licensing and Non-Transferability

Biotrans Protocol and its associated ethical structures are **non-transferable** intellectual property.  
They cannot be sold or exclusively licensed.  
However, derivative works **can reference, integrate, and build upon** these principles under the following conditions:

1. Attribution to ‚ÄúBiotrans Protocol‚Äù must be included in public documentation.  
2. Commercial use may require a royalty or partnership agreement based on the RVM score.  
3. Modifications or extensions must preserve the core ethical intent (repentance, conscience, forgiveness, diversity, non-coercion).  

> ‚ÄúBiotrans Protocol is not a commodity to be owned. It is a conscience-based public reference designed to guide and align AI systems and human institutions.‚Äù

---

## 5. Use Cases

- üß† **Educational AI platforms** referencing the Repentance-Based Ethical Layer.  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **AI governance tools** integrating the forgiveness and diversity-proof mechanisms.  
- üé® **Creative studios** building conscience-based content workflows.  
- üß™ **AI SDK developers** embedding Biotrans‚Äô ethical checkpoints into their model pipelines.

Each of these use cases can apply the RVM scoring system to determine appropriate attribution and potential royalty terms.

## 6. Public Commons Principle and Flexibility of Valuation

It is essential to emphasize that **Biotrans Protocol itself is a public ethical commons** ‚Äî not a commodity, not a product, and not a privately owned asset.  
It is intended to serve as a shared reference structure for humanity‚Äôs interaction with AI, grounded in repentance, conscience, forgiveness, and diversity.

Because of this, the **Reference Value Metric is not a fixed or absolute valuation tool.**  
Its purpose is not to impose rigid royalty rules or commercial boundaries, but to offer a **flexible reference framework** that can adapt to different contexts, projects, and scales.

- üìú The metric does **not** determine the intrinsic worth of Biotrans Protocol.  
- üìä It simply helps participants **approximate the relative value** of a system‚Äôs reliance on Biotrans principles.  
- ü§ù Final terms of attribution, royalty, or collaboration should always be decided **case by case**, with mutual agreement between parties.

> ‚ÄúBiotrans Protocol is a public commons ‚Äî a conscience-based foundation meant to guide, not to be owned. The Reference Value Metric is a flexible guidepost, not a fixed price tag.‚Äù

## Conclusion

The Reference Value Metric provides a practical bridge between the **public, non-transferable nature** of Biotrans Protocol and its **commercial, educational, and technological applications**.  
It ensures that while the protocol itself remains a conscience-based standard, its influence can be **quantified, respected, and fairly compensated** whenever it is used to shape real-world systems.

At the same time, it recognizes that **Biotrans Protocol belongs to the commons** ‚Äî and that all valuation and compensation models built upon it must remain **context-sensitive, adaptive, and rooted in ethical intent.**
