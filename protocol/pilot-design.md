## 🎯 Purpose of the Pilot
The pilot is designed to validate three fundamental hypotheses of the Biotrans Protocol:

1. **Truth Moment through Resonance**  
   - A deed is confirmed only when at least three independent witnesses resonate simultaneously.  

2. **Ethical Scarcity as Difficulty**  
   - Diversity across witnesses (culture, background, values) increases the difficulty, and therefore the weight, of each confirmed act.  

3. **Irreversible Record**  
   - Once a deed is witnessed and later resonances reference it, its truth becomes irreversible over time, similar to block confirmations in Bitcoin.

## 🛠️ Scope of the Pilot
- **Offline + lightweight mobile/web tools** to capture real-world resonance.  
- **Resonance events** recorded in minimal, privacy-preserving format.  
- **Anchoring methods** for long-term verification (e.g., commit hashes, public timestamps).  

---

## 🧩 Expected Outcomes
- Confirmation that three-person resonance can be reliably detected in real contexts.  
- Early validation that diversity can be translated into a measurable weighting system.  
- Demonstration that recorded deeds can be anchored in ways that resist later denial.

## 🔒 Ethical Guardrails
- No collection of personal identifiers beyond what is minimally required for diversity scoring.  
- No facial recognition, phone numbers, or surveillance-based methods.  
- Repentance and recovery remain core principles: mistakes cannot be erased, but they can be redeemed through genuine goodness.

## 📌 Note
A more detailed **technical implementation design** exists, but is maintained as an **internal confidential document**.  
Only the conceptual principles are shared publicly to preserve originality while preventing misuse.
