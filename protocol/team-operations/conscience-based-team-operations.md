# Conscience-Based Team Operations

_This document applies the philosophy of Biotrans Protocol (conscience, repentance, and inspiration) to practical team operations._

## 1. Team Size (Nodes)

- The smallest trusted unit is called a **Node**.  
- A Node typically consists of 5–10 members, small enough for direct trust circulation.  
- The organization itself is a **parallel network of Nodes** rather than a single centralized team.  
- Nodes are connected **horizontally**, without hierarchy or domination.  
- Nodes may:
  - Compete on the same project in A/B style, or  
  - Operate independently on separate projects.  
- Growth does not mean inflating one Node, but multiplying and interlinking trustworthy Nodes.

## 2. Entry Criteria
- Both **competence and conscience** are required.  
- Example questions:  
  - “In what situations would you say, ‘I am sorry, even if it was unintentional’?”  
  - “How have you repented from a past mistake?”  
- Responsibility and capacity for repentance are valued more than raw performance.

## 3. Trust Rules
- **Opportunities for repentance are limited.**  
  - Honest mistakes or immaturity may be given up to **two chances** for improvement.  
  - Each opportunity must be followed by visible behavioral change.  
  - If no improvement is shown after repeated chances, the member is excluded from the Node.  
- **Deliberate betrayal or blame-shifting = immediate exclusion.**  
  - Deception and intentional irresponsibility are not tolerated.

## 4. Reward Principles
- **Weight over performance.**  
  - Trust and conscience outweigh short-term revenue or speed.  
- **Autonomy-based rewards.**  
  - Rewards are given when individuals take responsibility and grow on their own, not under pressure.  
- **Fair and inclusive treatment.**  
  - Exceptional contributors receive incentives and recognition regardless of nationality, gender, or age.  
  - Merit is measured by trustworthiness and conscience-driven impact, never by demographic factors.

## 5. Conflict Resolution
1. When an issue arises, confirm directly with those involved.  
2. Separate **intention vs. outcome**.  
3. Evaluate the possibility of repentance → if genuine, allow; if not, exclude.  
4. Leave a record and share transparently.  

---

## 6. Long-Term Direction
- Team operations are grounded in **conscience, repentance, and inspiration**.  
- The goal is not merely to be a “high-performing team,” but to become a network that **endures through trust and repentance**.
