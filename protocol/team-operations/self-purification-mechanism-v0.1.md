### Purpose

This document defines the **self-purification structure** within Biotrans Protocol’s team operations.  
It ensures that the team’s ethical consistency is maintained **without command, punishment, or emotional conflict** — relying solely on resonance, sincerity, and moral alignment.

The mechanism represents the pre-data phase of the *MeritSBT system*, proving that ethics can operate naturally even before metrics are visualized.

---

### Core Principle

> “Only sincere resonance sustains; misaligned energy dissolves naturally.”  

The team’s environment is designed to amplify harmony and reduce discord through structural transparency and conscience-based interactions.  
False alignment, manipulation, or purely performative behavior loses momentum without confrontation.

---

### Operational Rules

1. **No Over-Counseling Principle**  
   – Offer clear, human feedback once or twice when appropriate.  
   – Repetition without response equals energy leakage; conscience must stay primary.

2. **No Exceptions Principle**  
   – Emotional exceptions corrupt the ethical field.  
   – Compassion is welcome, but deviation from conscience alignment is not.

3. **No Emotional Feedback Principle**  
   – Avoid rewarding performative enthusiasm or simulated sincerity.  
   – In this system, emotion is an *outcome of resonance*, not an operational input.

### Mechanism Flow

| Stage | Structural Behavior | Outcome |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| **1. Exposure** | Team operates on resonance-based communication; non-sincere members feel discomfort. | Self-detection of mismatch begins. |
| **2. Neutral Feedback** | No emotional reaction to flattery, urgency, or surface courtesy. | Manipulative rhythm loses effect. |
| **3. Energy Withdrawal** | Conversations remain calm, precise, and principle-driven. | False engagement fades. |
| **4. Voluntary Departure** | The individual perceives non-resonance and disengages naturally. | Harmony remains without conflict. |
| **5. Emotional Purification** | No internal gossip or judgment after departure. | The organization retains a clean frequency. |

### Feedback Integrity Criteria  
*(How to protect sincere people from burnout while preserving organizational resonance)*

#### 1. When Feedback Is Worth Giving  
**(Authentic Resonance Feedback – energy flows, not drains)**  
Give feedback when:
- The person **shows self-reflection or effort after the first mistake.**  
  → They pause, listen, and attempt adjustment without defensiveness.  
- The issue is **skill-related, not attitude-related.**  
  → Translation accuracy, clarity, or process understanding — not arrogance or entitlement.  
- The person **asks with humility**, e.g.  
  > “Could you help me understand what I missed?”  
- You sense **alignment with the protocol’s conscience**, even if results are incomplete.  
  → “The rhythm is right, only the execution needs refinement.”

✅ In these cases, one or two precise feedback sessions *nourish* both sides.  
They strengthen the team’s ethical field instead of draining it.

---

#### 2. When Feedback Becomes Energy Leakage  
**(Emotional Drain Feedback – resonance breaks, conscience dims)**  
Stop feedback when:
- The person **repeats the same pattern** after clear correction.  
- Their responses center on **justification, blame, or manipulation**, e.g.  
  > “I was just following AI output,” “You didn’t explain clearly.”  
- You feel a **heaviness, irritation, or fatigue** after speaking —  
  that’s the system signaling *misalignment*.  
- The conversation turns into **emotion management** rather than professional guidance.  
- The person subtly **uses your empathy as leverage** (guilt, pity, or dependency).

⚠️ These cases represent *emotional exploitation*, not collaboration.  
Each additional exchange drains the field and rewards the wrong rhythm.

---

#### 3. Core Principle
> “Feedback is sacred when it restores conscience;  
> profane when it protects ego.”  

Therefore:
- **Once or twice** for growth — always welcome.  
- **Repeated rescue** for ego — prohibited.  

Sincere people deserve structure that protects their compassion from depletion.

### Integration with MeritSBT

The **Self-Purification Mechanism** functions as the *pre-quantum layer* of the MeritSBT system.  
Once the merit index is formalized, these same ethical interactions can be quantified as *resonance scores* — ensuring that data inherits the same conscience-driven foundation.

---

### Summary

- **Core Ethic:** Truth resonates; pretense dissolves.  
- **Energy Policy:** Preserve sincerity; minimize emotional expenditure.  
- **Organizational Effect:** Conflict-free purification through moral frequency.  

This mechanism allows Biotrans to remain *structurally peaceful* even during personnel transitions or value realignments.  
It is not management by control — it is governance by resonance.
