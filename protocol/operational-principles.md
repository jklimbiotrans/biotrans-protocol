# Biotrans Protocol – Operational Responsibility Principles

These principles define the minimum standards for designers and operators,  
and apply equally to all participants.  
They will be directly applied to Biotrans-operated applications, services, and business activities.

---

## 1. Scope of Responsibility
- Take responsibility only for matters directly designed, managed, or decided by me.
- For areas beyond direct control, observe and respond, but do not assume responsibility for the outcome.

## 2. Opportunity Provision
- Offer 1–2 chances only to those with potential for change.
- End cooperation if unfaithful or malicious behavior is repeated.

## 3. Autonomy
- All change and participation must be voluntary, without coercion.
- Each person must bear the consequences of their own choices.

## 4. Operational Standards
- Prioritize structural stability and trustworthiness over personal preferences.
- Do not permit actions that compromise the core principles of the Ethical OS.
