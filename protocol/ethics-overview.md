## Abstract
This document examines the historical evolution of money—from primitive shells to gold, the petro-dollar system, and the rise of Bitcoin as a transparent, decentralized value storage medium.  
It analyzes the socio-economic forces driving distrust in centralized finance, the role of blockchain as a cross-check mechanism for sustainability, and the philosophical need for ethical human agency in an AI-driven society.  
Finally, it proposes a DAO model for decentralized, non-monetary trust metrics, forming part of the Biotrans Protocol Ethical OS framework.

## Preface: A Declaration on Liberation Day
On August 15, 2025, Korea celebrates Liberation Day, marking its independence from Japanese colonial rule.  
This day signifies “restoring the light” and stands as a historical turning point when freedom and dignity were regained after oppression.

I take this day as a symbolic turning point for a digital ethical order and declare:  

> “A structure in which an individual’s good deeds are transparently and fairly recognized as social assets.”

This document serves as a foundational reference for the Biotrans Protocol Ethical OS, exploring the history of money and trust, the social significance of blockchain, and proposing the future direction of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).  

The objective is not merely to discuss technology, but to design a human-centered, sustainable digital trust structure.

## 1. The History of Money: Evolution of Value Storage and Trust

### 1.1 Primitive Currencies and Precious Metals
- In the South Pacific islands, shells were used as currency for their durability, usability, and stable supply.  
- Gold and silver, valued for their rarity, ease of processing, resistance to tarnish, and aesthetic appeal, served as currency globally for centuries.

### 1.2 Gold Standard and Petro-Dollar
- Until the mid-20th century, the gold standard formed the foundation of international trust, with the US guaranteeing gold-dollar convertibility.  
- After the 1971 Nixon Shock, the petro-dollar system emerged, backed by oil—particularly from the Middle East—and remained dominant until the early 2020s.

### 1.3 Decline of the Dollar System
- Expanding fiscal deficits and excessive currency issuance weakened the link between commodities and the dollar.  
- This created a growing demand for new value storage mechanisms.

---

## 2. The Rise of Bitcoin and the Social Significance of Blockchain

### 2.1 Erosion of Trust After the Financial Crisis
- The 2008 global financial crisis exposed corruption and fragility within traditional financial institutions.  
- Demand grew for value storage systems that are inflation-resistant and have capped issuance.

### 2.2 Transparency and Immutability of Blockchain
- Bitcoin records every transaction permanently on the blockchain.  
- This stands in stark contrast to the opacity of fiat currency issuance.  
- As a result, Bitcoin functions as “digital gold,” serving as a long-term store of value.

### 2.3 Blockchain as a Social Cross-Check
- Over time, Bitcoin and similar blockchain systems act as mirrors that assess the sustainability of governments and financial systems.

## 3. Human Nature: The Return of Ethical Agency

### 3.1 The Driving Forces of the Modern Economy
- Modern economies operate on desire and debt.  
- While this can boost short-term growth, it also generates cyclical crises and deepens inequality.

### 3.2 Inflation and Collapse of Trust
- When currency degrades, citizens suffer from inflation, and trust in governance erodes.

### 3.3 The Era of Technological Transparency
- AI, data analytics, and social media now make it possible to trace an individual’s past actions and even infer intent.  
- ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) has moved from theory to practical, measurable systems.

### 3.4 The Need for Ethical Humans
- In a society where AI and robots replace most forms of labor, humanity’s distinction lies in ethical capacity and the ability to repent (moral transformation).  
- Repentance starts with reflecting on past harmful intentions and committing, through free will, to sustained good actions.

## 4. The Future of DAO: Decentralization and the Disclosure of Good Deeds

### 4.1 DAO Defined and Current Issues
- A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is designed to avoid corruption in centralized powers and enable autonomous, ongoing experiments in governance.  
- However, some projects have lost credibility due to rug pulls and concentration of power.

### 4.2 Proposed DAO Structure
- **50% ownership by ethical DAO operators**  
- **50% ownership by decentralized individuals**  
- These ratios are flexible and may be adjusted according to societal conditions in order to maintain an ethical, sustainable system over time.  
- Discovery and transparent acknowledgment of genuine good deeds as a seed for social trust metrics.

### 4.3 Social Credit System (Non-Monetary)
- A non-monetary, good-deed verification and disclosure system, with disclosure optional for individuals.  
- Serves as an alternative trust metric, even in scenarios where CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) are adopted.

### 4.4 Encouraging Voluntary Disclosure
- Expanding the awareness that revealing hidden good deeds generates greater positive cycles can help foster a culture of voluntary disclosure.

## 5. Reason for Release on Liberation Day
- Liberation = “restoring the light” → a society where individual good deeds illuminate the collective.  
- In the past, good deeds could not be quantified and were often misunderstood or ignored; now they can become a measurable driving force of societal growth.  
- I consider myself perhaps a 300 out of 1,000 on such a system, but I envision a society where anyone can, by free will, disclose their good deeds transparently.

---

## 6. Connection to Biotrans Protocol
- **Monetary history** → philosophical foundation for designing trust and value storage systems.  
- **Blockchain transparency** → applied in the immutable record structure of the repentance and “good point” system.  
- **Ethics-centered human model** → core of the DAO design based on inspiration and moral influence.  
- **DAO structure proposal** → early reference for the Biotrans DAO.  
- **Liberation Day symbolism** → historical and cultural originality.

## 7. 2030~2035 Outlook

Between 2030 and 2035, AI will increasingly attempt to simulate human intelligence, yet remain an uncontrolled form of reasoning, while also imitating emotions in incomplete and unstable ways.  
Robots capable of replacing human physical labor will trigger new waves of unemployment.  
To sustain a virtuous cycle within society, humanity must evolve beyond being merely creative beings into becoming ethical beings.  
Such ethical choice must be grounded in the individual’s free will to choose and perform good actions, with the freedom to decide whether or not to make such actions public.

| Period | Technological Change | Socio-Economic Impact | Ethical OS Response |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 2030~2035 | AI attempts to simulate human intelligence; uncontrolled reasoning and unstable emotional imitation | Large-scale replacement of human labor → new unemployment | Shift from creative being → ethical being |
| 2030~2035 | Full replacement of physical labor by robots | Labor market restructuring; inequality deepens | Good actions chosen by free will; disclosure optional |
| 2030~2035 | Expansion of AI-robot integrated services | Blurring of human-machine boundaries | Embed human-only repentance and conscience structure as the core of the social OS |

## Philosophical Signature
> "In the decentralized social credit and good-point allocation system I envision,  
> I would likely be an ordinary person scoring about 300 out of 1,000.  
> Yet, even if I make mistakes knowingly or unknowingly,  
> I hope for a society where, regardless of social status or position,  
> I can freely choose to disclose my good deeds—  
> and live happily as one of the ordinary citizens."
