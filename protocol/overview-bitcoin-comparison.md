# Biotrans Protocol ‚Äì Overview with Bitcoin Comparison (Public Draft v0.2)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notice**
> - This document presents **conceptual and ethical design principles only**.  
> - **No implementation details** (e.g., cryptographic circuits, time parameters, key handling) are included here.  
> - Unauthorized use for coercive, credit-scoring, or surveillance systems is **strictly prohibited**.  
> - This protocol is intended solely as a **prosocial ethical experiment**.

## üåç Vision
The Biotrans Protocol is an ethical operating system that treats good deeds as the object of mining.  
While Bitcoin secures value through mathematical difficulty and scarcity,  
Biotrans secures trust and value through ethical difficulty and resonance.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Bitcoin Mining vs. Goodness Mining

| Category            | Bitcoin                          | Biotrans Protocol                                                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mining Target       | Hash puzzles (mathematical)      | Good deeds + 3-person resonance                                     |
| Mining Tool         | GPU/ASIC, electricity            | Mobile app, conscience, real-world witnessing                       |
| Difficulty Adjust.  | Hash target recalibration        | Resonance difficulty (diversity across race, religion, gender, etc.)|
| Consensus           | Node validation                  | Minimum 3 simultaneous shout-outs (resonance)                       |
| Block Confirmation  | Proof of Work (PoW)              | Proof of Goodness (PoG) ‚Üí later resonances strengthen irreversibly |
| Rewards             | Bitcoin (fixed emission)         | Goodness points (ÂñÑÈªû), weighted by diversity & simultaneity        |
| Philosophy          | Mathematical scarcity ‚Üí trust    | Ethical scarcity ‚Üí communal trust                                   |

## üìå Core Principles

### 1. The ‚ÄúMoment of Truth‚Äù ‚Äì 3-Person Resonance
- One person‚Äôs claim is insufficient.  
- Two people‚Äôs alliance is insufficient.  
- At least three people must resonate simultaneously for the deed to be recorded as truth.  

**Charter Clause:**  
All records of goodness are validated only through the resonance of three or more individuals.  
A deed becomes a block only when free choices of conscience are confirmed by communal testimony.  

---

### 2. Resonance Difficulty and Rewards
- Homogeneous resonance (same group) ‚Üí base reward.  
- Heterogeneous resonance (diverse groups) ‚Üí higher reward.  
- Rare resonance (e.g., Christian + Muslim + Jewish) ‚Üí bonus reward.  
- Simultaneity: closer in time ‚Üí stronger weight.  
- Spread: additional inspired people ‚Üí exponential rewards.  

---

### 3. Proof of Goodness (PoG)
- A deed is not only recorded but also re-witnessed later.  
- Later resonances strengthen credibility ‚Üí irreversible truth.  

**Charter Clause:**  
Every block of goodness is strengthened over time by later resonances.  
Older deeds receive greater confirmation,  
becoming truths that cannot be erased without repentance.  

---

### 4. Invalid Blocks and Penalties
- Bitcoin: invalid blocks waste energy.  
- Biotrans: false claims waste trust.  

**Charter Clause:**  
Invalid blocks cannot be mined.  
In Bitcoin, energy is wasted.  
In Biotrans, trust is wasted.  
This loss cannot be restored except through repentance and authentic goodness.  

---

## üì± Participation ‚Äì Goodness Mining App
- Mobile app as witness tool.  
- ‚ÄúShout-out‚Äù button when seeing a good deed.  
- GPS, time, proximity validate real presence.  
- ‚â•3 simultaneous shout-outs ‚Üí block confirmed.  
- Both doer and witnesses gain goodness points.  

---

## ‚ú® Philosophical Summary
Bitcoin guarantees value through mathematical scarcity.  
Biotrans guarantees truth through ethical scarcity and diverse resonance.  

The hardest mining in the world is not solving a puzzle,  
but witnessing genuine goodness and resonating with it together.

## Restorative Bonus (Optional CBDC Bridge)

We keep **conscience records** (goodness blocks) separate from **economic ledgers**.  
However, to widen the door of repentance, an **optional restorative bonus** can be applied:

- If a person has a **low CBDC social score**, their validated good deeds (3-person resonance) may receive **extra weight**.  
- This is **opt-in, transparent, and revocable** by the individual.  
- Bonuses never affect basic rights or coercive controls; they only grant **additional perks** (e.g., fee rebates, micro-rewards).  
- No negative labels are used; only **recorded goodness** and **forgiveness signals** count.  

**Charter Clause:**  
‚ÄúEconomic systems may voluntarily recognize recorded goodness through a restorative bonus for the disadvantaged,  
without ever conditioning basic rights or survival on moral scoring.‚Äù
