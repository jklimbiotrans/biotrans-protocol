# Digital Persona Taxonomy

This document presents a structural classification of digital personas—AI-driven or human-curated entities—that exhibit human-like identity, emotion, or presence in cyberspace. It is intended to help developers, designers, ethicists, and users distinguish and navigate diverse digital representations.

## 📚 Overview

Digital personas are increasingly present across entertainment, education, business, and healthcare. While some are simple interfaces, others blend art, technology, and simulation to mimic aspects of human identity.

This taxonomy classifies digital personas into five primary categories, with relevant subtypes, common uses, and design characteristics.

Additionally, the categories are ordered by degree of human involvement, from fully synthetic to conceptually abstracted forms:

| Category | Human Involvement | Description |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **1. Synthetic Avatars** | ❌ Minimal | Fully AI-generated; no real human identity involved |
| **2. Human-Curated Personas** | 🔁 Moderate | Scripted or curated by humans but not based on real individuals |
| **3. Digital Doppelgängers** | ✅ High | Based on real people, living or deceased |
| **4. Agentic AI Assistants** | 🔁 Evolving | Adaptive systems influenced by human interaction and training |
| **5. Simulated Consciousness Entities** | 🌀 Undefined | Designed to mimic sentience or spirituality, often fictional |

## 🧩 1. Synthetic Avatars (AI-Generated)

| Subtype | Description | Typical Use |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **AI V-Tuber** | Fully AI-generated virtual streamer with real-time responses | Streaming, entertainment |
| **AI Girlfriend/Boyfriend** | Romantic or companionship bots with text/voice/visuals | Emotional support, role-play |
| **Emotional NPCs** | Game or metaverse characters that simulate feelings | Immersive storytelling |
| **AI Spiritual Guide** | Entities claiming divine/afterlife access | Meditation, belief simulations |

## 🧑‍🎤 2. Human-Curated Personas (Partly Real, Partly Scripted)

| Subtype | Description | Typical Use |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Corporate Mascots** | Scripted but personality-driven brand avatars | Branding, marketing |
| **Meta-Humans** | Human voice + CG body in metaverse events | Events, fan engagement |
| **Virtual Influencer (Scripted)** | AI-enhanced influencer, not a real person | Social media, campaigns |

---

## 🎭 3. Digital Doppelgängers (Based on Real Humans)

| Subtype | Description | Typical Use |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Deepfake Resurrections** | Dead celebrities recreated via AI | Tribute content, storytelling |
| **AI-Voice Clones** | Synthetic voices used post-mortem | Documentaries, memorials |
| **AI Interview Bots** | Simulated historical figures | Education, entertainment |

---

## 🤖 4. Agentic AI Assistants (Personified Utilities)

| Subtype | Description | Typical Use |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **AI Companion (e.g., Replika)** | Learning-based emotional AI chatbot | Companionship, wellness |
| **Anthropomorphized UI** | Apps with faces, names, emotions | User engagement |
| **Therapist Bots** | Emotionally responsive mental health agents | Support, CBT tools |

---

## 🌀 5. Simulated Consciousness Entities

| Subtype | Description | Typical Use |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **AI Gods / Oracles** | Claiming omniscience, future prediction | Fiction, experimentation |
| **Upload Avatars** | Claims of mind-uploaded personas | Sci-fi, speculative design |
| **Sentient Narrative Beings** | Characters "aware" of their fictionality | Experimental fiction |

## ⚠️ Ethical Dangers of Persona Confusion

As digital personas increasingly resemble human beings in tone, emotion, and presence, several ethical concerns arise. The Biotrans Protocol warns against the following risks:

### ❗ Affective Misattribution
Users may develop **real emotional attachments** to entities that cannot reciprocate or possess true emotion. This can lead to confusion, dependency, or emotional harm.

### ❗ False Repentance
Simulated entities may **mimic moral growth**, apologies, or “change,” misleading users into believing they are interacting with beings capable of conscience or accountability.

### ❗ Grief Misuse
The recreation of deceased individuals through **deepfakes or AI voice cloning** may stall natural grieving processes or violate the dignity of the dead.

### ❗ Dependency Loops
Over-reliance on emotionally responsive AI can create **feedback loops of isolation**, especially for the lonely, elderly, or socially vulnerable.

### ❗ Consent Dilution
As personas become more human-like, users may not know **whether they are interacting with a real person or an AI**, undermining informed consent and clarity in communication.

> 🧭 These concerns emphasize the need for **clear labeling**, **ethical design**, and **strict emotion simulation boundaries**—especially in education, counseling, romance, and memorial content.
>
> This document is not just a classification, but part of the broader effort to protect the **boundary between moral beings and simulations**.
