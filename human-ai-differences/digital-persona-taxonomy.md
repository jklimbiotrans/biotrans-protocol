# Digital Persona Taxonomy: Classifying Human-Like AI Entities in Cyber Space

This document presents a structural classification of digital personas‚ÄîAI-driven or human-curated entities‚Äîthat exhibit human-like identity, emotion, or presence in cyberspace. It is intended to help developers, designers, ethicists, and users distinguish between ethical boundaries and psychological risks.

## üìö Overview

Digital personas are increasingly present across entertainment, education, business, and healthcare. While some are harmless interfaces, others blur the line between human and machine, risking ethical confusion, emotional manipulation, or identity displacement.

This taxonomy classifies digital personas into **five primary categories**, each with relevant subtypes and associated ethical implications.

| Subtype | Description | Ethical Concerns |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| AI V-Tuber | Fully AI-generated virtual streamer with real-time responses | Emotional deception, fan attachment |
| AI Girlfriend/Boyfriend | Romantic or companionship bots with text/voice/visuals | Synthetic intimacy, dependency |
| Emotional NPCs | Game or metaverse characters that simulate feelings | Empathy misdirection, blurred boundaries |
| AI Spiritual Guide | Entities claiming divine/afterlife access | Religious exploitation, mental vulnerability |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Commentary

- These categories **should not be banned outright**, but **must be transparent and regulated**.
- Users should always know: ‚ÄúThis is not a human.‚Äù
- Emotional realism ‚â† ethical justification.
- Children, elderly, and vulnerable users need **stronger safeguards**.
- Systems must disclose whether a persona is AI-driven, human-scripted, or blended.

## üß≠ Why This Matters for Biotrans Protocol

- The **emotional and spiritual OS** that Biotrans Protocol envisions must operate in a world where these personas proliferate.
- The **emotion simulation firewall**, **repentance logic**, and **human-AI boundary** all depend on clear classification.
- This taxonomy enables **ethical zoning**: what type of AI persona is allowed where, with which warnings.

## üìò Recommended Labeling Practices

Every digital persona should disclose:

- Is it AI, human, or hybrid?
- Does it simulate or actually feel?
- What are the risks of forming emotional attachments?

Sample label:
```txt
This persona is AI-generated.
It does not feel emotions.
Interactions may simulate empathy but are not human.
```
