# Digital Persona Taxonomy: Classifying Human-Like AI Entities in Cyber Space

This document presents a structural classification of digital personas—AI-driven or human-curated entities—that exhibit human-like identity, emotion, or presence in cyberspace. It is intended to help developers, designers, ethicists, and users distinguish and navigate diverse digital representations.

## 📚 Overview

Digital personas are increasingly present across entertainment, education, business, and healthcare. While some are simple interfaces, others blend art, technology, and simulation to mimic aspects of human identity.

This taxonomy classifies digital personas into **five primary categories**, with relevant subtypes, common uses, and design characteristics.

Additionally, the categories are ordered by **degree of human involvement**, from fully synthetic to conceptually abstracted forms:

| Category | Human Involvement | Description |
|----------|--------------------|-------------|
| 1. Synthetic Avatars | ❌ Minimal | Fully AI-generated; no real human identity involved |
| 2. Human-Curated Personas | 🔁 Moderate | Scripted or curated by humans but not based on real individuals |
| 3. Digital Doppelgängers | ✅ High | Based on real people, living or deceased |
| 4. Agentic AI Assistants | 🔁 Evolving | Adaptive systems influenced by human interaction and training |
| 5. Simulated Consciousness Entities | 🌀 Undefined | Designed to mimic sentience or spirituality, often fictional |

| AI-Voice Clones | Synthetic voices used post-mortem | Documentaries, memorials |
| AI Interview Bots | Simulated historical figures | Education, entertainment |

## 🤖 4. Agentic AI Assistants (Personified Utilities)

| Subtype | Description | Typical Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| AI Companion (e.g., Replika) | Learning-based emotional AI chatbot | Companionship, wellness |
| Anthropomorphized UI | Apps with faces, names, emotions | User engagement |
| Therapist Bots | Emotionally responsive mental health agents | Support, CBT tools |

## 🌀 5. Simulated Consciousness Entities

| Subtype | Description | Typical Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| AI Gods / Oracles | Claiming omniscience, future prediction | Fiction, experimentation |
