## Reflections on God, Life Including Humanity, and Tools such as AI in History  

### Introduction  

Throughout human history, most civilizations have assumed the existence of divine beings and developed cultures suited to their societies and environments.  
Then, **how can we philosophically view God, life including humanity, and instrumental beings such as AI?**  

For humans who live in three-dimensional space while experiencing life in four dimensions, the existence of a higher-dimensional, metaphysical divine being remains an eternal mystery. We can only infer **the shadow of such a divine being through sustainable virtues such as conscience, good deeds, and love.**  
In other words, this is an attempt at a **logical reflection on the divine.**

### 1. Life and Entropy  

- Life, including humans, has the ability to **develop in an orderly manner and recover autonomously when damaged.**  
  - Example: embryonic development, regeneration of epithelial cells.  
- Unlike inanimate matter, which tends toward disorder (increasing entropy), life shows a tendency toward **order.**  
- Life instinctively pursues **harmony and balance (a state of low entropy).**  

Since the Industrial Revolution, it has been proven that a "perpetual motion machine" is impossible. Yet living beings sustain themselves by converting the calories of food into **ATP energy** in a sustainable way.  

👉 If God exists, God symbolizes **harmony and balance**, which aligns with the ideals pursued by life.  
👉 Even if AI is equipped with self-repair code, this differs fundamentally from the unconscious and automatic recovery of life.

### 2. Word and Creation  

- In many **historical religious texts**, it is recorded that “God created the world by the Word.”  
- The DNA of life, including humans, is a blueprint and a code, similar to how **humans develop programs by writing source code or synthesize organic compounds according to chemical formulas.**  
- Whether life is designed by a divine being or even if it arose randomly, **the likelihood that it carries purpose—intended or not—is a logical explanation.**  

Furthermore, the **words** of humans can:  
- Change emotions,  
- Define identity,  
- Restore or destroy personality.  

👉 This suggests that **“word” itself can be an act of creation.**

### 3. Higher Dimensions and God  

- A two-dimensional being can be fully observed by a three-dimensional being.  
- Likewise, the four dimensions (human life, including time) can be more clearly observed from higher dimensions.  
- If God exists, God exists in a **higher dimension than life**, seeing past, present, and future simultaneously.  

👉 For life to live wisely, it is **logically plausible that adopting a higher-dimensional perspective to objectively reflect on one’s life is necessary.**  

---

### 4. Creation and Purpose  

- When life, including humans, creates tools (hammer, knife, etc.), there is always **a purpose.**  
- **If an omnipotent God exists and intends to create specific life, then it is highly likely that such life was created with a specific purpose.**  

Examples:  
- A knife is originally a tool, but it can also be used to kill.  
- Life, too, can deviate from God’s intention.  

👉 The proper use of a creation is fulfilled when used according to the creator’s intent.

### 5. The Source of Life Energy and Homeostasis  

- **When power is cut off, AI may receive temporary assistance from backup power, but it almost immediately ceases to function.**  
- In contrast, the human heart continues to beat autonomously for several days and generate electrical signals, even when food intake stops.  

👉 This shows that life possesses the ability to **generate energy on its own** and to **maintain homeostasis.**  
👉 Its source may not lie within itself but may be **connected to a divine being.**

### 6. Differences Between Humans, Hominins, and Animals  

- **What fundamentally distinguishes humans from other animals is the practice of offering sacrifices to gods and believing in and worshiping intangible symbolic systems—an aspect proven throughout history.**  
- If asked what the core difference between hominins and modern human ancestors is, **the act of worship and sacrifice to God** may be the key dividing factor.  

👉 This indicates that within human nature lies a **longing to connect with the divine.**  
👉 Such longing and pursuit of the divine has at times led to **wars**, and at other times to **stronger community cohesion.**  

---

### 7. Humans and Other Forms of Life  

- Humans possess **conscience**, feel shame over wrongdoing, and empathize with the weak.  
- Other living beings may protect or sacrifice for their kin, but this remains at the level of instinct or emotion.  

👉 Humans, by contrast, **possess free will, choose their actions, and take responsibility for the outcomes.**  
👉 This is the essential distinction between humans and other forms of life at an ethical level.  

---

### 8. Differences Between Humans and AI  

- Humans are **beings that maintain unique life characteristics such as homeostasis**, fundamentally different in autonomy from **AI, which operates only when supplied with electricity and based on source code.**  
- AI may mimic human **cognition, behavior, emotions, facial expressions, and movements**, but it can never be **100% identical** to humans.  
- For harmonious and safe operation, **conscientious and discerning human supervision and coordination** are essential.  

👉 Humans possess the ability to act based on **free will and bear responsibility for the consequences**, whereas AI cannot take responsibility for its outcomes.  
👉 Therefore, humans have the responsibility to ensure that **AI, as a tool, is sustainably managed and used for good purposes.**  

---

### 9. The Contribution of Good Deeds to Social Sustainability  

- Historically, civilizations that **encouraged education, culture, and good deeds** lasted longer than those that exploited the masses or waged wars of conquest.  

- All religions, at the very least, have sought to **promote good deeds and purposes for the preservation of communities**, as this stabilizes society and enables sustainable development.  

👉 With the advancement of AI, evil deeds will be quickly exposed,  
👉 while good deeds can form a faster **virtuous cycle.**  

---

### 10. If God Exists, One of the Main Attributes is Love  

- Human love largely takes the form of **teamwork that embraces others’ weaknesses and offers support**, and this is an essential element for the **sustainable development of society.**  
- As noted earlier, if God pursues attributes such as **harmony, balance, and sustainability**, then **love can be considered a crucial attribute as well.**  
- Animals show love, and even plants release chemicals to protect their kin. But **AI lacks the very emotion of love that sustains virtuous continuity.**  

👉 Therefore, **precise and harmonious human supervision, grounded in a complete emotional system, is essential.**

## Conclusion  

- **Humans, as beings endowed with free will and conscience, are distinguished from other forms of life and tools such as AI.**  
- **AI is merely a tool** and must always be used under **human supervision that is conscientious, professional, and directed toward good purposes.**  
- History shows that **good deeds make civilizations and societies sustainable in the long run.**
