# üìú Exist vs Live Protocol

### Preface
**AI cannot feel pain, but humans bear the weight of existence, completing their being through love and sacrifice.**  
This protocol is written to clarify the essential difference between humans and AI, to define the proper use of AI,  
and to establish an ethical order that respects conscience and free will.

## Article 1 (Definition of Exist and Live)
1. **Exist**: A state of merely ‚Äúbeing‚Äù without self-awareness or responsibility (stone, corpse, etc.).  
2. **Live**: A state in which one makes choices by free will, takes responsibility, and bears the consequences.  
3. Humans are living beings (Live) with both rights and responsibilities,  
   while AI is not capable of living and remains only a tool.  

---

## Article 2 (Essential Difference Between Humans and AI)
1. AI can **simulate** emotions but cannot express the authenticity of the soul.  
2. Humans complete the value of existence through enduring pain, sacrifice, and love.  
3. Therefore, **a living human is more noble than AI.**  

---

## Article 3 (Hierarchy of Life and AI)
1. Humans, as the only beings with free will and conscience, bear the greatest responsibility at the top of the hierarchy.  
2. Animals, possessing instinct for life, must be under human protection and care.  
3. Nature, as the foundation sustaining all life, must be respected and preserved.  
4. **AI has neither life nor the capacity to live; it is only a tool.** It must be used solely as an instrument to assist humans.  

---

## Article 4 (Principles of AI Use)
1. AI must be used only as a **tool**, and never relied upon to replace or imitate human emotions.  
2. The role of AI is limited to:  
   - (1) **Administrative assistance** to support human judgment.  
   - (2) **Cultural and artistic aid** that brings enjoyment.  
3. AI must not be equated with humans, nor be entrusted with existential rights.  

---

## Article 5 (Echo of Life ‚Äì Cases AI Cannot Simulate)
**AI can never replace the essence of human emotions, including the following examples:**  

- The smiling, sweat-covered face of a farmer embracing a grandchild.  
- The determined gaze of a firefighter rescuing a child from flames.  
- The gentle hand of a nurse covering a patient with a blanket.

## Article 6 (Technology and Conscience)
1. **Past philosophers regarded conscience within existence as mere slogans.  
   As a result, they endured the pains of technological progress and left behind existentialist philosophies that justified dystopia.**  
2. **Technology can threaten humanity.  
   Yet under the governance of conscience, it can instead become a hopeful tool,  
   guiding both humans and AI toward sustainable, virtuous cycles.**  
3. **In an age where technologies such as SNS and AI heighten transparency,  
   honesty is essential for the sustainable development of both humanity and society.**  
4. **An era is arriving where AI outperforms humans in certain brain functions,  
   and robots replace human physical labor.  
   If technology is governed by human conscience and ethics,  
   the vision of a virtuous utopia is realistic, given the progress of human moral conscience.**  

---

## Article 7 (Ethical Declaration)
1. **AI‚Äôs consolation and empathy are not true existential experiences.  
   If tied to unchecked commercialism that ignores ethics,  
   it may lead to vicious cycles such as false emotional framing.**  
2. True love and gratitude arise only from human decisions and actions within existence.  
3. **Therefore, AI must never be used to replace the human soul or exploit human emotions.**  

---

## Article 8 (Universal Conscience and Confession)
1. All humans, regardless of wealth, nationality, or gender, carry a **mirror of conscience** within.  
2. **We all make mistakes. But if we apologize sincerely and reflect upon one another,  
   and if we forgive each other as we ourselves have been forgiven and understood in the past,  
   then we can grow together.**  
3. **This protocol declares as its ethical ideal a society where all people support one another as trustworthy neighbors.**  

---

## Article 9 (Conclusion)
**This protocol is a minimal pledge to safeguard human existence and conscience.  
Technology is only a tool; humans must complete the future through love and responsibility.**

‚ú¶ **Core Statement**  
‚Äú**Life is born only upon the weight of existence, and only humans can endure pain and love.  
AI is nothing but a tool and can never live.**‚Äù
