## 1. Life and Entropy  
Life tends toward order and balance, unlike inanimate matter.  
If God exists, harmony and balance align with lifeâ€™s pursuit of order.

## 2. Word and Creation  
DNA functions like code, similar to human programming.  
Life is unlikely to be random; purpose is a logical explanation.

## 3. Higher Dimensions and God  
A higher-dimensional being can see past, present, and future simultaneously.  
Wise living requires reflecting from a higher perspective.

## 4. Creation and Purpose  
All tools are made with purpose.  
If God exists and creates life, it is likely with intention.

## 5. Life Energy and Homeostasis  
AI stops without power.  
Life sustains itself and maintains homeostasis, possibly linked to a divine source.

## 6. Differences Between Humans, Hominins, and Animals  
Humans uniquely worship and sacrifice, showing a longing for the divine.  
This sets modern humans apart from other hominins.

## 7. Humans and Other Forms of Life  
Humans possess conscience, free will, and responsibility.  
This ethically distinguishes humans from other forms of life.

## 8. Differences Between Humans and AI  
AI can mimic but not replicate human life, conscience, or responsibility.  
Ethical human supervision of AI is essential.

## 9. The Contribution of Good Deeds to Social Sustainability  
Civilizations that encouraged education and good deeds endured longer.  
AI can accelerate exposure of evil and spread of good.

## 10. If God Exists, One of the Main Attributes is Love  
Love sustains society and reflects divine attributes.  
AI lacks love, reinforcing the need for human guidance.
