# ✦ Exist vs Live Protocol – Summary

### 1. Exist vs Live
- **Exist**: mere being without life or responsibility (e.g., stone, corpse).  
- **Live**: living beings that experience pain, respond to environment, and make choices.  
- Humans uniquely possess free will and conscience among living beings.

### 2. Humans vs AI
- Humans: bear conscience, responsibility, love, and sacrifice.  
- AI: simulate emotions but lack true life; only tools.

### 3. Hierarchy
- **Humans**: unique living beings with free will and conscience; highest responsibility.  
- **Animals**: living beings deserving respect and protection.
