# Biotrans Protocol Roadmap (Draft, 2025-09-16)

Biotrans Protocol is an **ethical experiment**, not a financial product.  
The project aims to design a minimal, conscience-based operating system for trust and resonance.  
Like Bitcoin, it follows a long-term cycle of experimentation ‚Üí niche adoption ‚Üí gradual integration,  
but with a different purpose: **ethics, not currency**.
