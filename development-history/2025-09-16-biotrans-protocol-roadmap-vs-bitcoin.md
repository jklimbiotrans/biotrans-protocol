# Biotrans Protocol Roadmap (Draft, 2025-09-16)

**Biotrans Protocol** is an **ethical experiment and public good**,  
not a financial product, not a cryptocurrency, and not an investment vehicle.  

The purpose is to provide a minimal **"Ethics OS"** that can inspire and enable  
various DAO projects, research initiatives, and community experiments worldwide.  
Like Bitcoin, the project begins with an initial prototype and declaration ‚Äî  
but its essence is ethical resonance, not currency.

## üìå Roadmap

### Phase 0: Foundation (2025‚Äì2027)
- Publish ethical declarations and specifications on GitHub  
- Small-scale simulators & DAO prototypes  
- Focus: Research, transparency, voluntary participation  

### Phase 1: Niche Adoption (2028‚Äì2030)
- Pilot use-cases in communities, fandoms, and DAO experiments  
- Early collaborations with academia / NGOs  
- Focus: Cultural and ethical resonance  

### Phase 2: Pre-Institutional Phase (2030‚Äì2033)
- Presented at ethics forums and digital peace initiatives  
- Limited adoption by NGOs / local institutions  
- Focus: Interoperability and minimal governance  

### Phase 3: Institutional Integration (2033‚Äì2035)
- Possible adoption as an ‚Äúethical OS layer‚Äù in public or corporate services  
- Formal partnerships with research institutes  
- Focus: Sustainability & DAO-based governance

## üìù Personal Note (Satoshi-style Disclaimer)

I am **not building Biotrans Protocol as a company or product**.  
My role is only to provide the **initial prototype, declarations, and roadmap**.  
From here, the protocol should be treated as a **public good** ‚Äî  
free to be studied, forked, and expanded by communities, DAOs, or researchers.  

I will personally focus on **Biotrans Studio** (creative work in translation, media, and storytelling).  
The protocol, once published, belongs to the world ‚Äî not to me.
