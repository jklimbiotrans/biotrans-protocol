# Biotrans Protocol Roadmap (Draft, 2025-09-16)

**Biotrans Protocol** is an **ethical experiment and public good**,  
not a financial product, not a cryptocurrency, and not an investment vehicle.  

The purpose is to provide a minimal **"Ethics OS"** that can inspire and enable  
various DAO projects, research initiatives, and community experiments worldwide.  
Like Bitcoin, the project begins with an initial prototype and declaration ‚Äî  
but its essence is ethical resonance, not currency.

## üìå Roadmap

### Phase 0: Foundation (2025‚Äì2027)
- Publish ethical declarations and specifications on GitHub  
- Small-scale simulators & DAO prototypes  
- Focus: Research, transparency, voluntary participation  

### Phase 1: Niche Adoption (2028‚Äì2030)
- Pilot use-cases in communities, fandoms, and DAO experiments  
- Early collaborations with academia / NGOs  
- Focus: Cultural and ethical resonance  

### Phase 2: Pre-Institutional Phase (2030‚Äì2033)
- Presented at ethics forums and digital peace initiatives  
- Limited adoption by NGOs / local institutions  
- Focus: Interoperability and minimal governance  

### Phase 3: Institutional Integration (2033‚Äì2035)
- Possible adoption as an ‚Äúethical OS layer‚Äù in public or corporate services  
- Formal partnerships with research institutes  
- Focus: Sustainability & DAO-based governance

## üìä Comparison: Bitcoin vs Biotrans Protocol

| Phase | Bitcoin (BTC) | Biotrans Protocol |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Phase 0 | **2009‚Äì2012**<br>Small experiments, cypherpunk community, governments highly critical | **2025‚Äì2027**<br>Ethical declarations, DAO simulators, research focus |
| Phase 1 | **2013‚Äì2016**<br>Niche expansion, Mt.Gox collapse, still outside institutions | **2028‚Äì2030**<br>Pilot use in communities/fandoms, academic & NGO pilots |
| Phase 2 | **2017‚Äì2020**<br>Futures and exchanges regulated, institutions begin to notice | **2030‚Äì2033**<br>Presented at ethics forums, limited NGO/local gov adoption |
| Phase 3 | **2021‚Äì2024**<br>ETF approvals, institutional accumulation, asset class recognition | **2033‚Äì2035**<br>Adopted as ‚Äúethical OS‚Äù in public/corporate services, DAO governance |

## üåç Intent: Complementing Competitive Capitalism

The current global structure is based on endless competition and uniform growth,  
which creates pressure not only on ordinary people but also on the global elite.  
Even those at the very top are locked into a race of survival, expansion, and control.  

**Biotrans Protocol** proposes a complementary layer:  
a transparent **Merit System (ÂñÑÈªû)** that rewards ethical resonance.  

This is not meant to replace markets or currencies,  
but to function as a *balancing mechanism* ‚Äî  
similar to how **social safety nets and modified capitalism** (welfare state, post-Depression reforms)  
helped stabilize societies in the 20th century.  

By introducing a **conscience-based OS**,  
the aim is to provide *room for breathing* even for the global upper class,  
while enabling fairness, forgiveness, and long-term trust across layers of society.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Dehumanization Across All Layers

In the current competitive-capitalist structure,  
**everyone risks becoming dehumanized** ‚Äî not only the lower classes.  

- Ordinary citizens: bound by debt, rent, and credit cycles.  
- Middle layers: trapped in endless performance and survival races.  
- Global elites: pressured to maintain power and capital, unable to stop running.  

This system does not discriminate ‚Äî it reduces all participants into *functions of survival*.  

**Biotrans Protocol** seeks to counter this trend.  
By introducing a transparent **Merit System (ÂñÑÈªû)** based on conscience, forgiveness, and resonance,  
it offers a supplemental layer where human dignity can be recognized and rewarded.  

The aim is not to overthrow capitalism,  
but to *humanize it* ‚Äî in the same way that modified capitalism (welfare states, post-crisis reforms)  
once provided balance after periods of unchecked exploitation.

## üìù Personal Note (Satoshi-style Disclaimer)

I am **not building Biotrans Protocol as a company or product**.  
My role is only to provide the **initial prototype, declarations, and roadmap**.  
From here, the protocol should be treated as a **public good** ‚Äî  
free to be studied, forked, and expanded by communities, DAOs, or researchers.  

I will personally focus on **Biotrans Studio** (creative work in translation, media, and storytelling).  
The protocol, once published, belongs to the world ‚Äî not to me.
