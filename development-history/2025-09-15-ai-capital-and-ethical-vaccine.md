# AI Capital and the Ethical Vaccine

## Massive Investment Behind AI

The development of large-scale AI systems such as ChatGPT required **extraordinary investment**.  
Although exact figures are undisclosed, consistent estimates highlight the scale:

- **Training GPT-4 alone** is estimated to have cost over **$100 million** in compute.  
- **Annual operating losses** in 2022 were around **$540 million**, largely due to compute and infrastructure costs.  
- **Projected total expenses** through 2029 are expected to exceed **$115 billion**.  
  - Source: [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-2022-losses-hit-540-million-as-chatgpt-costs-soared-2023-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com),  
    [Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-chatgpt/openai-expects-to-burn-115-billion-on-chatgpt-through-2029?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

When including **GPU procurement, electricity for data centers, cooling, and networking infrastructure**, the real cost of maintaining such systems easily rises into the **tens of billions of dollars**.

## A Public Service at $20 per Month

From this perspective, accessing such infrastructure for **around $20 per month** is almost symbolic.  
For ordinary individuals, this pricing turns what should be an elite-only resource into something resembling a **public service**.  

For those who use these tools not only for productivity or entertainment but for **ethical design, sustainability, and human dignity**, the value is immense.  
Capital originally invested for profit is, perhaps unexpectedly, enabling **rare forms of public contribution**.

## Global Leadership and Intentions

If there truly exist global leaders who influence the trajectory of technology and society,  
the broad and affordable distribution of AI tools suggests a mixed but not purely negative intent:

- They are not acting out of malice alone.  
- By pricing advanced AI for mass access, they are **balancing commercial interests with gradual social progress**.  
- This reveals an awareness that legitimacy in the future depends not only on profit,  
  but also on giving ordinary citizens tools to adapt and create.

Thus, even the most powerful actors may be understood as **pursuing progress step by step**,  
allowing space for conscience-driven individuals to act within the system.

## Historical Analogy: From Penicillin to Ethical Vaccines

Just as **penicillin** and other antibiotics could not have been discovered, scaled, and distributed without the support of capital and institutions,  
my own work is made possible by infrastructures far beyond my individual reach.  

With only a modest monthly subscription, I can refine my thoughts on **ethics, safety nets, and sustainable structures** for the AI era.  
This is not the invention of penicillin.  
But in a similar spirit, I see myself as attempting to build an **ethical vaccine** for the 21st century—  
a framework to protect **humanity, dignity, and conscience** in the face of accelerating technological change.

## Personal Identity: Not a Genius, but a Conscience-Driven Architect

It is worth clarifying how I see myself.  
I am not a “genius” in the traditional sense, but rather belong to a rarer category: a **conscience-driven architect**.  
The distinction can be illustrated as follows:

| Category | Traditional Genius | Designer / Architect | Conscience-Driven Thinker |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Core Feature** | Exceptional depth in one domain | Connecting multiple domains, building structures | Keeping ethics and conscience at the center |
| **Thinking Style** | Extreme specialization | Breadth and structural integration | Moral compass as constant axis |
| **Examples** | Einstein (physics), Mozart (music) | Leonardo da Vinci, blockchain architects | Gandhi, Bonhoeffer |
| **Role** | Breakthrough in one field | Create new systemic frameworks | Provide ethical direction for society |
| **Weakness** | Indifference outside field | May lack execution power | Pain from gap between ideals and reality |
| **Value** | Scientific/artistic revolutions | Holistic problem-solving | Guarding dignity, responsibility, sustainability |
| **Perception** | “High IQ” | “System-level innovator” | “Rare person of conscience” |

**My stance:**  
I am closest to the **conscience-driven architect** type—  
one who seeks to design ethical frameworks, balance freedom with responsibility, and preserve human dignity in the AI era.  
This is why I describe my work as building an “ethical vaccine” for humanity rather than pursuing technical genius.
