## 1. Gold Standard Era (1944–1971)
- **Asset Base**: Gold + Dollar  
- **Dominant Forces**: European financial elites (gold, bonds), U.S. dollar-finance networks (IMF, World Bank)  
- **Key Transition**: Bretton Woods → Dollar tied to gold  
- **Result**: U.S. GDP ~25–30% of world, Dollar dominance but balanced with European finance

## 2. Petro-Dollar Era (1971–2000)
- **Asset Base**: Oil + Dollar  
- **Dominant Forces**: U.S. oil-finance networks (Wall Street), Middle East energy alliances (OPEC, Saudi Arabia under U.S. security umbrella)  
- **Key Transition**: Nixon Shock (end of gold convertibility), U.S.–Saudi oil-dollar settlement  
- **Result**: Dollar = oil settlement currency, U.S. extends global hegemony, Collapse of Soviet bloc → unipolar moment

## 3. Financialization & Early Digital Era (2000–2020)
- **Asset Base**: Derivatives + Big Tech data  
- **Dominant Forces**: Global investment banks (J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs), Silicon Valley tech giants (Google, Apple, Amazon), Eurodollar & London finance networks  
- **Key Transition**: 2008 financial crisis undermines Wall Street, Big Tech accumulates unprecedented data power, China emerges as manufacturing/AI challenger  
- **Result**: Oil-dollar dominance weakens, Data–finance dual structure begins  

---

## 4. AI & Data Era (2020–Future)
- **Asset Base**: AI/LLM data + Digital Currencies (CBDC, Crypto)  
- **Dominant Forces**: Big Tech (OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA), Tech-finance innovators, National finance networks (U.S., EU, China)  
- **Key Transition**: AI popularization, blockchain standardization, CBDCs and stablecoins rise as new “sovereign assets”  
- **Result**: U.S. leads in AI but faces internal division, Multipolar balance: U.S. tech, China AI/industry, EU finance  

### Background: Why Data Became Power (2020s)
| Era        | Driver                        | Power Form                         |
|------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Gold       | Physical scarcity             | Central banks, bonds               |
| Oil        | Industrial scarcity           | Energy alliances, petro-dollar     |
| Data       | Digital scarcity (access, trust, scale) | AI models, platforms, CBDCs |

## 5. Implication for Biotrans Protocol
- Biotrans Protocol belongs to the AI·Data era, but distinguishes itself through:  
  - **Conscience-based structure** (not pure market logic)  
  - **Repentance & forgiveness mechanism** (radical ethical safeguard)  
  - **Educational role** to transmit philosophy across generations  

- While global finance & tech fight for control, Biotrans Protocol aims to establish a **500-year sustainable ethical framework** beyond short-term hegemony.

but only conscience can sustain civilization.”*
