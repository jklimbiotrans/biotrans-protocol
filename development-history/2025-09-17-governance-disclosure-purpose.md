# Governance Disclosure Purpose (2025-09-17)

I decided to publish governance-related principles of the Biotrans Protocol not as finalized rules, but as open reference points.  

The main reason for disclosure is to invite technically skilled contributors to:  
1. Review and validate the theoretical foundations.  
2. Build concrete models and simulations of the principles.  
3. Develop and test diverse beta versions in real-world conditions.  

This document clarifies that Biotrans Protocol is not a closed project.  
It is an open ethical experiment where transparency ensures that the protocol cannot be monopolized, politicized, or distorted by a single group.

## Politics and the Need for Ethical Records

In politics, no party or faction is ever 100% right or 100% wrong.  
Both in Korea and the United States, it is common that a policy once supported while in government is opposed after moving into opposition, regardless of its intrinsic value.  
This inconsistency shows why a transparent reference record of ethical actions would be valuable — a kind of *conscience ledger* that is independent of political or religious affiliation.  

The idea is similar to how Bitcoin transparently records issuance and transactions of money:  
Biotrans Protocol aims to transparently record *acts of goodness and resonance* as an ethical reference, not as an instrument of control.

## Background of Resonance Diversity

The concept of *Resonance Diversity* did not arise directly from political polarization itself.  
Originally, the idea was only to ensure diversity through basic demographic factors such as **age** and **gender**, since people naturally differ in perspective across these dimensions.  

However, observing the recent rise of political extremism and irrational polarization across countries made it clear that this principle must go deeper.  
It is not enough to guarantee demographic variety alone — diversity in resonance must also guard against capture by partisan agendas or factional dominance.  

This realization reinforced the importance of Resonance Diversity as a core safeguard.  
It is not only a technical feature but a philosophical response to the erosion of shared ethical ground.  
By openly publishing governance principles and concrete IT protocol designs, the aim is to stimulate competition and cooperation among diverse beta versions,  
so that the system can evolve and strengthen through practical testing in the real world.  

At the very least, **conscience and the Golden Rule principle (“treat others as you would like to be treated”)** remain more universal than partisan loyalties.  
Even if interpretations vary across cultures, the ideas of empathy, fairness, and reciprocity can serve as a minimal baseline for valid resonance.

## Conscience Over Politics

Each individual case must be judged solely by **conscience**, not by political alignment or partisan pressure.  
Biotrans Protocol therefore explicitly refuses to participate in political disputes or ideological debates.  
Its role is to provide transparent ethical reference records, independent of shifting power struggles, so that trust is built on conscience rather than faction.  

Furthermore, judgments must be made with professional rigor, guided by **conscience** and by considerations of **social sustainability**.  
Only by holding to these standards can the protocol maintain legitimacy and long-term resilience.

## Future Outlook: AI and Transparency

Looking ahead, the combination of AI and Resonance Diversity could further enhance the integrity of this system.  
Through computer vision and motion recognition, AI can verify good deeds (with consent) and cross-check them with human resonance records.  
Features like Good Point validation, public “shout-outs,” and diversity proofs can be integrated to ensure that no single group dominates or distorts recognition.  

If applied responsibly, AI would not act as a controller but as an amplifier of transparency —  
a tool to make policies, social actions, and collective decisions more visible, auditable, and communicable.  
By cross-checking ethical actions through both human resonance and machine validation, AI could transform into an enabler of open dialogue and shared accountability,  
helping societies move beyond partisan suspicion toward a baseline of trust.
