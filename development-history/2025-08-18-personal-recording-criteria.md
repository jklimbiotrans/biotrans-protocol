# Personal Recording Criteria  
*(Biotrans Protocol – Observer’s Note, Aug 18, 2025)*

This document outlines my **personal criteria** for deciding what to record in the Biotrans Protocol development history.  
It reflects the perspective of a single observer at this time, not an official or fixed rule.  
Future revisions may change as circumstances evolve.

---

## 1. Cases Linked to Social Structures
When AI, robotics, translation, or media developments directly intersect with ethics or inspiration models.  
- Example: YouTube auto-dubbing → emotional distortion, cultural translation authenticity issues.  
- Example: Machine translation factories vs. trust-based translation team model.  

**→ Record when social/market change collides with ethical structure.**

---

## 2. Universal Ethical Risks
When the phenomenon has a **global impact**, beyond one culture or generation.  
- Example: Commodification of emotion.  
- Example: AI emotional mimicry without responsibility.  
- Example: Linking moral records to credit systems.  

**→ Record as “universal warnings.”**

---

## 3. Repentance and Restoration
When the **human-only capacity for repentance** is revealed, or when a structure shows **repentance impossibility (discard case).**  
- Example: A public figure admitting past mistakes and transforming their life.  
- Example: Attempt to design “repentance” for AI/robots → issue warning.  

**→ Record boundaries of repentance and its absence.**

---

## 4. Experimental Response Models
When alternative structures or countermeasures are actually proposed or tested.  
- Example: Non-commercial ethics DAO.  
- Example: Voluntary moral-sharing system in schools.  

**→ Record as archive of alternatives, not just criticism.**

---

## 5. Key Turning Points in Development History
When the Biotrans Protocol’s early structures (2025) show influence or resonance in wider society.  
- Example: 2026 – Institution adopts a Biotrans-like concept.  
- Example: International body attempts to link emotional data to basic rights.  

**→ Record as “resonance timeline.”**

### Note
These criteria are **not absolute**.  
They are meant to help me focus on significant and meaningful records, while avoiding trivial or purely temporary opinions.
