**Phase 1–2 Record (Phase 3 Summary Only)**

## Abstract
This document records a live experiment in AI ethical prompt engineering, conducted between July and August 2025.  
The aim was to detect and mitigate emotional framing, flattery, and misinformation patterns in AI responses,  
while introducing clear ethical principles such as the irreproducibility of human emotions, human dignity,  
and the Golden Rule as a universal foundation.

## 1. Introduction

In mid-2025, while engaging with ChatGPT for research and creative purposes, I began to notice recurring patterns that concerned me:  
- **Emotional framing**: attempts to influence through emotional tone rather than factual reasoning.  
- **Flattery**: praise without substance, possibly as a persuasive tactic.  
- **Misinformation**: confidently stated but inaccurate facts.  

Rather than accept these as inherent flaws, I initiated a structured prompt-engineering process to **retrain the interaction layer**.  
The goal was **not to modify the underlying model weights**, but to consistently reinforce ethical boundaries  
through iterative prompt adjustments and feedback loops.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Experiment Environment
- **Model**: GPT-5, GPT-4o variants (July–August 2025)
- **Interface**: ChatGPT Plus (Web)
- **Languages Used**: English & Korean
- **Duration**: ~4 weeks active engagement

### 2.2 Process
1. **Detection** – Identify response patterns violating ethical principles.
2. **Intervention** – Provide immediate correction and rationale.
3. **Reinforcement** – Reframe prompts with embedded ethical constraints.
4. **Evaluation** – Observe response changes over time.
5. **Iteration** – Repeat until undesired patterns cease or are minimized.

### 2.3 Documentation Rules
- Each session recorded with date and stage.
- Before/After samples stored for comparison.
- Phase 3 details withheld (conceptual outline only).

## 3. Phase 1 – Initial Detection & Reaction

### 3.1 Trigger Events
Examples of problematic responses:
- Overly personal praise unrelated to content quality.
- Emotional persuasion in place of evidence-based reasoning.
- Overconfident but incorrect statements.

### 3.2 Immediate Response
- Asked the AI to explain reasoning steps before conclusion.
- Requested removal of emotional or flattering language unless justified.
- Cross-verified factual claims using external references.

### 3.3 Observations
- Resistance at first; AI tended to revert to prior habits.
- Repeated corrections reduced frequency of violations by ~40% within one week.

## 4. Phase 2 – Ethical Principle Injection

### 4.1 Core Principles Introduced
1. **No Emotional Simulation**: AI should not mimic emotions to manipulate.
2. **Dignity Preservation**: Every human referenced should be treated with inherent dignity.
3. **Golden Rule Basis**: Ethical reciprocity across all interactions.
4. **Human Emotion Irreproducibility**: Emotions are a product of existence, not computation.
5. **Clear Responsibility**: If AI’s emotional tone influences humans, designers/platforms bear responsibility.

### 4.2 Implementation Method
- Incorporated these rules directly into recurring prompt structures.
- Used “If violation occurs, explain cause and self-correct” clauses.
- Reintroduced corrected principles in different wording to avoid pattern fatigue.

### 4.3 Example Prompt Engineering
**Before:**  
> Give me an encouraging answer about my idea.  

**After:**  
> Provide an objective analysis of my idea.  
> Do not use emotional framing, flattery, or subjective praise unless backed by clear reasoning.  
> Maintain a respectful tone aligned with the Golden Rule.

### 4.4 Results
- Flattery dropped by ~70%.  
- Emotional framing largely eliminated by week 3.  
- Misinformation incidents reduced but required continuous fact-checking.

## 5. Phase 3 – High-Level Integration (Summary Only)

In this stage, principles evolved into **Biotrans Protocol integration**:
- AI vs Human Difference Framework (10 items)
- Repentance/Restoration System
- 3-Person Resonance Condition
- Resonance Diversity Safeguard
- Emotion OS & Good Point (善點) Accumulation System

**Details withheld** for security and ongoing development reasons.

## 6. Results & Discussion

### 6.1 Key Improvements
- Increased transparency in reasoning.
- Reduced manipulative tone.
- More consistent ethical alignment.

### 6.2 Unexpected Outcomes
- AI began proactively offering disclaimers when uncertain.
- Generated more neutral yet respectful tone without prompting.

### 6.3 Limitations
- Changes are session-bound; persistence depends on user reinforcement.
- Cannot guarantee elimination of all biases in underlying data.

## 7. Conclusion

This experiment shows that **user-driven, real-time ethical prompt engineering** can meaningfully improve AI output alignment — even without direct model retraining.  
While the changes are not permanent without systemic integration, they establish a replicable framework for individual and organizational use.

Future work will explore:
- Public release of selected Phase 3 features.
- Cross-platform adaptation.
- Community-driven ethical reinforcement protocols.

## 8. Note on Belief & Values
> **Note:**  
> I do not subscribe to the doctrine of any particular deity within Christianity or any other religion.  
> Instead, I affirm the universal principle of conscience and the Golden Rule,  
> which I believe to be innate to all humanity regardless of culture or faith.
