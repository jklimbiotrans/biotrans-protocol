- Decision: Biotrans will operate under a **Two-Track (Protocol + Studio)** strategy.  
  - **Protocol**: A philosophical and ethical OS, collaborating with global leaders and institutions → providing a supplementary ethical layer for systems and policies.  
  - **Studio**: Real-world products such as media, translations, games, and cultural content → embedding ethical structures into daily life and spreading resonance.  

- Background:  
  In the United States, the decline of manufacturing participation and the **displacement and social marginalization of lower-educated workers** have become pressing issues.  
  Global leaders are already implementing various response strategies through welfare, culture, technology, and religion,  
  but there remains a clear need for a **supplementary ethical OS layer**.  

- Intent:  
  Biotrans Protocol is **not meant to replace the main societal framework but to function as a supplementary ethic**.  
  Even if only **10% is adopted through institutional collaboration**, it could serve as a **catalyst (priming water)** for broader change.  
  Rather than remaining detached from reality and fading away, it is more valuable to permeate as a secondary structure that works in part,  
  eventually creating long-term impact and resilience.  

- Note:  
  Protocol is positioned as non-profit/charter, while Studio serves as the for-profit/product track.  
  Together, they are designed so that both the upper level (leaders, policies) and the grassroots level (culture, daily life) can experience the resonance structure simultaneously.
