YouTube Auto-Dubbing Case and Emotional OS Risk Analysis  
📅 August 18, 2025 (KST)

## 1. Personal Experience Background
In August 2025, while working as a freelance translator and video editor in Korea, I directly observed a case where YouTube's auto-dubbing function was enabled by default on a client’s channel.

The client did not intend this, but YouTube automatically generated audio tracks in other languages.  
This strongly suggested that the user’s original voice data was collected and utilized without explicit consent.  
This incident is more than a minor technical inconvenience—it is an early warning that emotional/voice data misuse for model training may soon escalate.

## 2. Technical Analysis
- **Training Structure**  
  Auto-dubbing is not just subtitle translation; it vectorizes voice data and stores it in LLM/TTS models.  
  Individual creators’ voices, intonations, and emotional tones become dataset assets.

- **Data Utilization**  
  (Surface) Providing dubbing service → (Reality) Accumulating user voice/intonation data.  
  Unlike traditional news archives, this absorbs personal and emotional speech patterns of ordinary creators.

- **Expected Expansion**  
  Beyond “voice → dubbing,” the scope may expand to facial expressions, gestures, and emotional reactions.  
  Authentic human emotions may be commodified as data, enabling AI/robots to replicate them.

## 3. Emotional OS & Ethical Risks
- **Risk of “Emotional Zombies”**  
  Younger generations (teens and 20s), immersed in dopamine-driven shorts and synthetic relationships, may grow up without experiencing the true weight of emotion.  
  This erodes the capacity for mature emotions like love, sacrifice, and repentance.

- **Disappearance of Effort and Pain**  
  Historically, humans recovered authentic emotions through hardship, failure, and repentance.  
  Digitalized emotional consumption weakens or erases this formative process.

- **10-Year Dystopian Scenario**  
  Human emotions are converted into datasets, owned and sold by Big Tech.  
  Expressions and words are copied without authenticity, turning society into an “emotional zombie” network.  
  Even repentance (true transformation) may become impossible.

- **Rural vs. Urban Divide**  
  In rural environments, some insulation from constant algorithmic exposure remains.  
  Cities, however, may become high-density zones of emotional zombification, where authentic relationships collapse fastest.  
  This raises the prospect that true human emotion might survive only in peripheral, less-connected communities.

## 4. Philosophical Commentary
> “Emotion is not computation.  
> It is a reaction rising from the weight of existence,  
> and those who do not feel that weight cannot have emotions.”  
> — Biotrans Protocol, Ethics Declaration (Preface)

AI may simulate emotions, but it lacks the weight of existence.  
Thus, emotions born of human pain, effort, and repentance are non-transferable to data.  
If this boundary collapses, society faces the collapse of its ethical emotional OS.

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendations
Convenience technologies like auto-dubbing are not neutral; they are gateways to datafying human emotions and existence.  
Unless explicit consent and transparent data use are enforced today,  
within a decade society may face the rise of an emotional zombie civilization.
