# 2025-09-09 Online Foundation Declaration

**Description**  
This document records the idea of establishing the Biotrans Protocol as an **online/virtual foundation**, instead of creating a legal offline entity.  
It is part of the development history and not an official specification.  
The purpose is to preserve autonomy, avoid unnecessary regulatory exposure, and ensure continuity of the protocol through public archives.

---

## 1. Core Idea
- The Biotrans Protocol Foundation will exist as an **online/virtual entity**, not as a registered legal body.  
- Its role is fulfilled by **public archives** (GitHub, Arweave, IPFS) and **transparent governance documents**.  
- No centralized board, trustees, or legal incorporation will be established at this stage.

---

## 2. Operational Principles
1. **Archival Foundation**  
   - GitHub repositories act as the main archive.  
   - Permanent copies stored on Arweave/IPFS ensure immutability.  
   - Every document commit serves as a timestamped public record.  

2. **Open Participation**  
   - Discussions and contributions may happen through Issues, Pull Requests, or DAO-style voting in the future.  
   - All participation remains voluntary, with no binding obligations.  

3. **Continuity Without Legal Entity**  
   - Anyone may fork the protocol, but the **original archive hashes** remain the reference point.  
   - The system is designed to outlast any single person or institution.  

---

## 3. Disclaimer
- This is **not a legal foundation**, corporation, or registered non-profit.  
- It has **no authority over financial matters, donations, or token issuance**.  
- Its sole function is to preserve the philosophical and structural integrity of the Biotrans Protocol in a decentralized and transparent manner.

---

## 4. Purpose
By declaring the Biotrans Protocol as an **online foundation**,  
the project remains true to its guiding values: **conscience, autonomy, and distributed inspiration**.  
The foundation exists as a **living archive**, not a centralized institution.

## 5. Context Note (September 2025)

- On **September 9, 2025 (KST)**, Eric Trump delivered a virtual address at the **Upbit D Conference in Seoul**, urging Asia to lead in cryptocurrency adoption and praising South Korea as “doing it the best” in the region.

- He also projected that crypto markets will experience explosive growth within the next 12–18 months, citing Asia’s readiness and South Korea’s leading role.

- Around **September 7, 2025 (KST)**, I received a translation request concerning Eric Trump’s conference video.  

- I felt this moment carries symbolic weight—**Korea and the U.S. potentially aligning to ease regulation and encourage decentralization, democracy, and DAO engagement**.  

- This aligns with the Biotrans Protocol vision: structural change is not merely theoretical, but increasingly part of global discourse.
