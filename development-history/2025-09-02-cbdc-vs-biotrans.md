# CBDC vs Biotrans Protocol: Evil vs Good Human Nature

## 1. Basic Premise
- **CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)**: Built on the assumption of **human selfishness/evil (Xunzi’s view)**, emphasizing control and regulation.  
- **Biotrans Protocol**: Built on the assumption of **human goodness (Mencius’ view)**, emphasizing free will, conscience, and voluntary good deeds through a DAO-based system.  

These two approaches are not opposites but rather **two wings for sustaining society**:  
- **Preventing harmful behavior → CBDC (control-based)**  
- **Encouraging good behavior → Biotrans Protocol (DAO-based)**

## 2. Insights from South Korean Society
- **Hiring experience**: A candidate promised long-term commitment during the interview but quickly changed attitude and quit within days when faced with difficulties.  
- **Labor and social issues**:  
  - Sharp minimum wage hikes intensifying conflicts between small business owners and young workers.  
  - Perceived reverse discrimination against men who serve mandatory military duty.  
  - These cases show that the issue is not about **age**, but about **how innate desires and selfishness are managed for sustainable society**.

## 3. Philosophical Background: Mencius vs Xunzi
- **Innate Goodness (Mencius, 性善說)**  
  - Humans are inherently good.  
  - Proper environment and education allow this goodness to flourish.  
  - Order can be maintained through **conscience and moral self-regulation**.  

- **Innate Selfishness/Evil (Xunzi, 性惡說)**  
  - Humans are inherently selfish and driven by desire.  
  - **Laws, discipline, and external control** are necessary for order.  

👉 Biotrans Protocol = **Mencius’ view (goodness, voluntary virtue)**  
👉 CBDC = **Xunzi’s view (selfishness, regulation)**  

⚖️ **Note**  
This is not about blindly worshiping Eastern philosophy.  
- Similar debates exist in **Western philosophy**.  
- The real issue is how to **respect free will, human rights, and happiness**, while proposing **realistic and responsible alternatives** for the long-term sustainability of society, nations, and the world.

## 4. Future Outlook (2035–2050)
- **By 2035**: AI will assist in governance, justice, infrastructure, and traffic. Human actions, emotions, and even **inner motivations** may be inferred with high probability.  
- **The irony**: The more everything is monitored, the more valuable **choosing good through free will** becomes.  
- **By 2050**: Free creativity and voluntary virtue will be essential. A **transitional coexistence of CBDC and Biotrans Protocol** will be needed.  

---

## 5. Conclusion
- A society cannot survive on **control (CBDC)** alone.  
- Nor can it rely solely on **free will (Biotrans Protocol)**.  
- Only through **complementary coexistence** can we preserve:  
  - Social vitality  
  - Economic sustainability  
  - Human creativity and conscience
