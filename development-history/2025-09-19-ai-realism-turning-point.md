### Historical Note

> **[2025 Record, 19 September]**  
> I once thought **the day AI would look human-like would only come after 2030**, but my assumption was wrong.  
>  
> In this K-pop fanmade video, countless viewers commented that they thought it was an actual live-action shoot. The expressions, movements, lighting, and even audio were so natural that the old belief — *“video equals evidence”* — has collapsed.  
>  
> The comment section reflects this shift: “scary,” “I thought it was real,” “please label AI.” This marks the **first collective turning point where the public could not clearly distinguish reality from synthesis.**  
>  
> **The timeline is faster than expected.**  
> What matters is not only technological progress, but that **public perception itself has already broken down.**  
>  
> To prepare for situations like today, I had **especially created** the following sections in the repository **biotrans-protocol**:  
> - [biotrans-protocol/human-ai-differences/](https://github.com/jklimbiotrans/biotrans-protocol/tree/main/human-ai-differences)  
> - [biotrans-protocol/ethics-charter/](https://github.com/jklimbiotrans/biotrans-protocol/tree/main/ethics-charter)  
>  
> These sections emphasize that **AI may simulate emotions, but cannot truly have them — and that human dignity arises from the weight of existence.**  
>  
> The video itself already displayed a YouTube guideline warning:  
> *“이 콘텐츠가 제작된 방식 변경되었거나 합성된 콘텐츠, 상당히 수정되었거나 디지털 방식으로 생성된 사운드 또는 영상입니다.”*  
>  
> However, this incident shows that such disclaimers are not enough. In the future, **AI-generated videos will likely require embedded watermarks or persistent provenance markers.** Even more critically, since the voices and faces of politicians or public figures can be fully replicated (deepfakes), societies will need to decide **how to introduce unique identity mechanisms (e.g., SBT-based authentication) in a sustainable way — balancing privacy, human rights, and trust.**  
>  
> This entry should remain in the development history as the point where **the human–AI boundary blurred for the masses, while also becoming a philosophical moment to reaffirm human dignity.**
