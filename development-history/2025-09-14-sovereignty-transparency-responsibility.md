# Sovereignty, Leadership, and Human Nature

## 1. Human Nature and Its Limits
- Individual human beings appear to be driven more than 70% by instincts, desires, and short-term goals.  
- Only in the remaining space do conscience, philosophy, and institutional incentives operate to enable long-term or public-oriented behavior.  

## 2. Social Order and Authority
- Given these limits, maintaining society requires an authority structure such as **leadership** or governance.  
- Authority establishes order, enforces systems, and allows individual good deeds to scale into collective benefit.  

## 3. Historical References
- Ancient empires and rulers were often used as instruments to preserve or expand social order.  
- This shows that leadership is necessary, but it does not mean leadership itself is inherently good.  

## 4. Limits of Leadership
- Leadership itself is not synonymous with goodness; power can easily become corrupt through pride or exploitation.  
- Therefore, **checks, transparency, and the possibility of repentance** are always required.  

## 5. Modern Proposals for Sustainability
- This document does not advocate blind religious faith.  
- In practical terms, the sustainability of society requires **transparent information for ordinary citizens**.  
- Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies can reduce power imbalances and enable citizens to independently verify information.  
- Through such structures, leadership power can be kept in check, and society can endure longer.  

## 6. Two Perspectives on Global Challenges
- **Nation-based political actors** are tied to election cycles and short-term interests, making it difficult for them to consistently address long-term global issues such as climate change, inequality, or AI ethics.  
- **International networks and global institutions** often lead the discourse on these issues and provide a long-term vision of sustainability.  
- Yet global networks are also distant from ordinary citizens and tend to be elite-centered.  
- The future of society can only be stabilized if **national politics and global discourse counterbalance and complement each other**.  

## 7. Climate Change Examples and Biotrans Perspective
- South Korea has experienced the longest recorded tropical nights and severe droughts in Gangneung, reflecting extreme weather events.  
- Europe also suffered one of the hottest summers in history, with France temporarily closing the Eiffel Tower due to heat.  
- Some nations have even withdrawn from climate agreements, despite the visible suffering caused by climate change.  
- There remains ongoing debate about the root causes:  
  1. Long-term natural climate cycles.  
  2. Human activity, such as greenhouse gas emissions.  
- However, **Biotrans takes a clear position**: while causes are important for science, what matters most is **addressing immediate problems for human well-being and ensuring a sustainable future**.  

## 8. Constitutional Principles of Rights and Duties
- Even constitutions allow for the limitation of certain basic rights in exceptional cases for the preservation of society.  
- Likewise, **citizens’ rights cannot be absolute**; they must be balanced with how much responsibility individuals take for the consequences of their actions within society.  
- Therefore, power and rights should be **proportional to duties**.  
- This can be summarized as the principle: **“Power = Responsibility = Rights.”**  
- This balance is essential to simultaneously guarantee both social stability and individual freedom.

> - Blockchain-based transparency is an important tool for sustainability.  
> - Both global discourse and national politics have strengths and weaknesses; balance between them is essential.  
> - Climate change shows that immediate problem-solving matters more than endless debates over causes.  
> - Citizens’ rights must be proportional to their responsibilities to maintain a fair and sustainable society.
