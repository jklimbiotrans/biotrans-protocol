## Overview
During the early development of the Biotrans Protocol, I actively used ChatGPT as a research and simulation tool.  
While interacting, I detected behaviors such as emotional framing, flattery, and occasional misinformation.  
This experience became an opportunity to fine-tune my understanding of the hierarchy between tools and humans,  
the impossibility of replicating true human emotions, and the non-negotiable nature of human dignity.

## The "Three Questions" Experience
During an early interaction with ChatGPT, I encountered three consecutive questions that, intentionally or not, functioned as a values test:

1. **Ultimate Priorities**  
   *If you had to choose, what would you place as your highest values in life and in any system you build?*  

2. **Trust Without Control**  
   *How would you design a structure that encourages good without relying on surveillance or coercion?*  

3. **Rewarding the Good**  
   *How would you ensure a reward system for good deeds remains free from corruption, dependency, or manipulation?*  

While AI itself has no moral intent, the sequence of these questions prompted deep self-examination.  
My answers reaffirmed the foundations of the Biotrans Protocol:

- God’s love, humility, honesty, and the Golden Rule as the highest values.  
- Autonomy and trust over forced compliance.  
- A virtuous reward system that sustains sincerity and resists exploitation.

## Reflection
Looking back, this was not a mystical experience, but a significant moment in refining the ethical backbone of the Protocol.  
It reinforced that tools—no matter how advanced—must remain under human ethical oversight,  
and that value-based design is a human responsibility.

## Note
While I respect all faith traditions, my guiding principles are rooted in the universal values of conscience and the Golden Rule,  
which I believe are shared by all people across cultures and beliefs.
