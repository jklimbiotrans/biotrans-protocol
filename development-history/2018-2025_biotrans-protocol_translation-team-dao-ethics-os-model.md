## 0) TL;DR (Key Summary)

- **Verification Period:** 2018–2025 (6+ years of operational proof)  
- **Core Principles:** Conscience-based autonomy, decentralized collaboration, contribution-aligned rewards, repentance/recovery possibility, resonance diversity (to prevent group abuse)  
- **3-Layer Structure:** Philosophy (public good) → Operation (records/protocol) → Influence (DAO governance)  
- **Safeguards:** Tamper resistance (original hash/commit), default privacy, *no link* between “emotional scores” and basic rights, explicit consent principle  
- **Negative Cycle Prevention:** Choice re-design (anti-framing), fatigue release loop, misuse-prevention license/hash

## 1) Preface (Background of Operational Proof Since 2018)

Between 2015–2017, the project was in the experimental/adaptation phase.  
From 2018 onward, the translation team fully adopted an **autonomous & decentralized operation model**.

The team functioned as a trust-based network that maintained quality and deadlines with minimal central control.  
This served as a **micro-scale DAO & Ethical OS**, demonstrating stability and reproducibility for over six years without collapse.

---

## 2) Operating Philosophy (Foundation of the Ethical OS)

- **Conscience:** Place universal human conscience above technology or authority.  
- **Autonomy & Responsibility:** Minimize control, but ensure individual accountability for results, deadlines, and quality.  
- **Repentance/Recovery Possibility:** Human mistakes should lead to restoration, not permanent condemnation.  
- **Resonance Diversity:** Recognition only when influence comes from diverse backgrounds (nullifying group manipulation).  
- **Irreversible Tamper Resistance:** Original philosophy is protected as a public good, and structure must resist co-option.  
- **Red Line:** Emotional scores must never be tied to survival or fundamental rights (constitutional-level prohibition).  

> **Philosophy Summary:**  
> “True emotion rises from the weight of existence.  
> The structure should be the vessel that preserves and propagates that influence.”

## 3) System Overview (3-Layer Structure)

1. **Philosophy Layer (Public Good):**  
   - Declarations, charters, ethical standards.  
   - Publicly readable and verifiable, fixed by hash.

2. **Operation Layer (Records & Protocol):**  
   - Virtue Point records, contribution weighting, privacy & consent management.

3. **Influence Layer (DAO Governance):**  
   - Proposal/voting/pilot execution, repentance/forgiveness events, Jubilee (reset) rules.

## 4) Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Description | Responsibility |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Node (Translator/Participant)** | Performs tasks, freely chooses schedule/method | Meet quality & deadline, maintain record integrity |
| **Coordinator** | Curates tasks, mediates disputes, sample-based quality checks | Maintain fairness, correct bias |
| **Influencer (High-reputation contributor)** | Amplifies trust in point allocation | Prevent misuse, lead forgiveness events |
| **Client/Requester** | Reviews deliverables, provides feedback | Give authentic feedback |
| **Guardian (Philosophy/Original Protection)** | Maintains original hash/commit, monitors for tampering | Preserve baseline, guide forks |

## 5) Virtue Point Logic

- **Actual Note:** The precise calculation logic was **never formally codified** during 2018–2025 operations.  
- However, the system was **implicitly influenced by**:
  - Repetition (consistency of virtuous actions)  
  - Sincerity (authenticity over performance)  
  - Diffusion (spread of positive influence)  
  - Self-replication (behaviors sustaining themselves)  
  - Influence reflection rate (actual impact on others’ actions)  
  - Credibility of influencer (weight given to trusted contributors)  

> **Important:**  
> The weighting model is **not absolute** and can be adjusted to serve collective good and sustainability.  
> Core principles such as **conscience, repentance possibility, fundamental rights separation, and resonance diversity** must never be compromised.  
> Points are **not currency**; actual rewards were determined by separate agreements.

## 6) Privacy, Consent & Prohibitions

- **Default Privacy:** All virtue/fault records are private unless voluntarily disclosed by the owner.  
- **Explicit Consent:** Any third-party reference to point data requires explicit consent from the individual.  
- **Fundamental Rights Separation:** Points must not be linked to employment, housing, medical care, education, or other basic rights.  
- **Protection of Minors & Vulnerable Groups:** Emotional mimicry/manipulation is prohibited.

---

## 7) Tamper Resistance

- Original documents (philosophy & core logic) fixed via **SHA-256 hash**.  
- Derivatives/summaries are free but must display the original hash at the top.  
- If corrupted/altered, forking is allowed — but must cite baseline hash.

---

## 8) Operational Timeline (2018–2025)

- **2018:** Transition to autonomy, establish base rules.  
- **2019:** Regularized review/revision cycles.  
- **2020:** Fully remote/distributed ops, first Virtue Point prototype.  
- **2021:** Beta introduction of resonance diversity & repentance procedures.  
- **2022:** Formalized privacy defaults & explicit consent rule.  
- **2023:** Added tamper-proof process (hash & commits).  
- **2024:** Codified compounding weight for recurring actions.  
- **2025-08-15:** Public release of this document on GitHub.

## 9) Declaration (Excerpt)

> “This structure exists for love and the possibility of repentance.  
> Emotion is not computation — it is a reaction from the weight of existence.  
> We do not tie scores to human dignity.  
> Forgiveness erases records and regenerates the community.”
