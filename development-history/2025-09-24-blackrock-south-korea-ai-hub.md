## 2023
- Worked on subtitles for **K-pop “차린 건 쥐뿔도 없지만 – Karina 편”**, which became **the #1 YouTube video in South Korea in 2023**.  
- Also contributed to other top-level cultural content such as the **차쥐뿔 series**, demonstrating the power of K-pop as global local data.  
- These works showed that **K-culture (K-pop, drama, games)** can serve as *unique, irreplaceable training data* for AI systems.  
- This confirmed the early insight: *“South Korean local data is a global asset.”*

## 2024
- Conducted translation projects on international finance and bond-related media, including **BlackRock-related requests**.  
- This positioned Biotrans not only in the **cultural translation industry** but also in **financial and policy-related translation**, bridging culture and capital.  
- During this time, the principle was recorded on GitHub:  
  > “CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) will inevitably be required as AI and capital flows converge.”

### Why CBDC is Inevitable
- **Structural Necessity**  
  - As AI and capital flows converge, *Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)* becomes a structural requirement.  
  - It ensures transparent, programmable, and efficient circulation of value within society.  

- **South Korean Context**  
  - In South Korea, daily issues such as **illegal parking, tax evasion, and inconsiderate behaviors** highlight the difficulty of maintaining social order through voluntary compliance alone.  
  - A purely analog tax system cannot effectively address the problem of individuals pursuing short-term desires or selfish interests.  
  - CBDC offers **efficient tax collection, transparent transactions, and reduced leakage**, which strengthens the foundation of social trust.  

- **Public Safety and AI Integration**  
  - When connected with **AI monitoring systems** (e.g., cameras, smart city infrastructure), CBDC can help reduce crime rates by ensuring accountability and traceability.  
  - This creates measurable **public benefits**, such as safer communities and fairer allocation of resources.  

- **Ethical Balance (Biotrans Approach)**  
  - However, a CBDC regime must not be **purely regulatory or coercive**.  
  - For genuine legitimacy, it must be paired with a **conscience-based system**.  
  - The Biotrans Protocol envisions:  
    - **DAO-based choice**: individuals may voluntarily choose whether to **make their good-deed records (善點, “Merit Points”) public**.  
    - **Repentance and forgiveness mechanisms**: ensuring people are not trapped by past mistakes but have a pathway to restoration.  
    - **Happiness and autonomy**: maintaining personal freedom while encouraging positive social behavior.  

- **Conclusion**  
  - CBDC is inevitable as the **minimum order-preserving infrastructure** in modern society.  
  - Yet its success depends on combining **regulatory efficiency** with **human dignity and conscience-based autonomy** — exactly the balance proposed by Biotrans.

## 2025
### September: BlackRock – South Korea Partnership
- On **September 23, 2025**, President **Lee Jae-myung** met **Larry Fink**, CEO of **BlackRock**, to discuss South Korea’s role as **Asia’s AI hub**.  
- They agreed to cooperate on:
  - **Hyperscale AI data centers**
  - **Renewable energy transition**
  - **Global AI industry partnership**
- This marked the visible entry of BlackRock’s global capital into South Korea’s AI infrastructure.

### Interpretation
- This event confirms the Biotrans prediction: **CBDC, AI, renewable energy, and ethical governance are inseparable.**  
- The U.S. will manage global society with AI (as a modern “church”),  
- South Korea will provide the **Ethics OS** (Biotrans Protocol, conscience-based system),  
- And BlackRock will integrate these into the **global capital framework**.  
- Furthermore, as hyperscale data centers arise in South Korea, the **true value lies in the content of big data**.  
- In particular, **South Korean cultural values** — sacrifice, community spirit, consideration, and *jeong* (정) — if embedded into global AI,  
  they can contribute not only to cultural enrichment but also to addressing real social issues such as **reducing drug abuse and violent crime in the United States**.  
- BlackRock has also announced moves into **STO (Security Token Offerings) and RWA (Real World Asset tokenization)**, enabling fractional investment not only in **stocks and real estate** but potentially in **creative works (copyrights) and even good deeds or ethical expressions**.  
- If **acts of conscience and kindness** can also be recorded and verified as authentic assets, this could directly contribute to a healthier society.  
- The **Biotrans Protocol** would naturally belong within this category, as an ethics-based certification and governance layer.  
- Meanwhile, **Biotrans Studio** will operate under the same philosophy, focusing on **creative and cultural works**, extending the ethical principles of the protocol into practical content production.  
- **Important Clarification:** This perspective does not imply unconditional support for global capital. The stance here is *practical*: whether climate change is temporary or structural, if rising global temperatures directly harm human life, crop yields, or the environment, then urgent measures must be taken — by any means necessary — to protect **sustainability and human happiness**.

## Summary
- **From 2023 cultural projects → 2024 financial translations → 2025 AI-capital partnership**,  
- Biotrans Protocol has consistently anticipated and participated in the convergence of **culture, capital, and conscience.**  
- South Korea’s cultural data is uniquely positioned to enrich global AI, providing **ethical depth** that complements U.S. AI management and BlackRock’s capital framework.  
- With **STO/RWA expansion**, not only financial assets but also **creative works and ethical deeds** can be tokenized and verified, where Biotrans Protocol and Biotrans Studio will play a meaningful role.
