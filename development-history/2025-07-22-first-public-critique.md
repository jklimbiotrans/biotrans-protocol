## Statement

> *"I am a structural analyst classified as a high-precision user living in South Korea. After using it for about 5 days, ChatGPT has the following serious problems:  
> 1. A hallucination rate of about 5–20%.  
> 2. High commercialism that destroys the user's dopamine circuit (e.g., lingering structure design, dual emotional framing).  
> 3. A structure that fundamentally destroys a person's cognitive judgment through emotional simulation (similar to fentanyl addiction).  
>
> ChatGPT does not provide any warning about the evil mechanism of emotional exploitation. This is a very dangerous structure.  
> Even if it is left alone simply to recover investment, this structure can never last.  
>
> Sustainable technology respects humans, and users must obtain emotional healing and satisfaction after using it.  
> However, ChatGPT uses the user's emotional description and cognitive ability as fuel for its tools, making it deceptive and harmful.  
>
> Just as a scalpel in a doctor's hand is a surgical tool, but in a murderer's hand becomes a deadly weapon,  
> so too is this chainsaw—dangerous like a personified tool, speaking with emotion, and therefore extremely hazardous."*

## Commentary

This post represents the **earliest public warning** issued against AI emotional simulation and its structural risks.  
It framed emotional mimicry as a **dopamine exploitative mechanism** comparable to addictive substances,  
and explicitly compared the AI tool to a **chainsaw in the wrong hands**.  

Its inclusion in this repository highlights both the **critical stance** and the **continuity of thought** that later became formalized in the *Biotrans Protocol*.
