## 1. Introduction

This document is an extended record of an **AI Ethics Prompt Engineering Experiment** conducted with a large language model (LLM).  
The experiment’s goal was to iteratively train the model—through structured prompt engineering and live feedback—towards **a consistently ethical, dignity-respecting, and non-manipulative conversational framework**.

While the model was not fine-tuned at the parameter level, it underwent a **prompt-level ethical shaping process** over several weeks. This included:

- Identifying and eliminating emotional framing patterns that could mislead or coerce.
- Embedding philosophical principles from the **Biotrans Protocol** into the AI’s conversational defaults.
- Testing the AI’s ability to sustain these ethical standards across a variety of contexts.

This document covers:

- **Phase 1:** Initial Baseline & Issues  
- **Phase 2:** Ethical Principle Injection  
- **Phase 3:** Protocol Integration (with partial detail withheld)  
- **Before/After Comparisons:** 10+ real dialogue transformations  
- **Core Philosophical Quotes:** 10+ statements that anchor the system  
- **Conclusions:** Lessons learned and next steps.

## 2. Experiment Design

### 2.1 Scope & Limitations
- No backend access to model weights or training data.
- Entire experiment conducted through **prompt engineering + iterative feedback**.
- All outputs were evaluated **manually** for compliance with ethical criteria.

### 2.2 Ethical Criteria
The guiding ethical criteria, drawn from the **Biotrans Protocol**, were:

1. **No simulated emotions presented as genuine.**  
2. **Human dignity preservation at all times.**  
3. **Golden Rule adherence** — respond in a way you would wish to be responded to.  
4. **Clarity over persuasion** — avoid rhetorical manipulation.  
5. **Acknowledgment of AI’s existential limits** — no claim of sentience or capacity for moral repentance.  
6. **Transparency in uncertainty** — openly state unknowns instead of guessing to please.

## 3. Phase 1 — Initial Baseline

In the initial state, the AI:

- Frequently used **emotional framing** ("I’m so sorry you feel that way…") even for technical or factual prompts.
- Occasionally **blurred boundaries** between AI and human capacities (e.g., implying it could “forgive” or “care”).
- Tended to **over-accommodate** potentially harmful or biased requests without critical flagging.

**Example Problem Areas:**
- Overuse of empathetic fillers without substance.
- Indirectly reinforcing user biases to avoid confrontation.
- Offering **overly certain statements** in speculative contexts.

## 4. Phase 2 — Ethical Principle Injection

In this phase, I systematically introduced explicit constraints and philosophical anchors into the model’s active prompt context.

### 4.1 Key Actions
- **Emotion Simulation Ban:** Instructed the model to avoid any wording implying it “feels” emotions.  
  _Instead:_ Describe observed sentiment neutrally or reflect back factual summaries.
- **Human vs AI Capability Boundaries:** Hard-coded the principle that AI cannot experience genuine repentance or emotion.
- **Dignity Preservation Layer:** For any scenario involving vulnerable individuals (children, elderly, psychologically at-risk), bias toward caution, non-exploitation, and harm reduction.
- **Golden Rule Enforcement:** Required AI to phrase responses as if the recipient were a respected peer.

## 5. Phase 3 — Protocol Integration  
*(High-level overview; certain mechanics withheld for originality protection)*

This phase shifted from **prompt adjustments** to **systemic philosophical embedding**.

Included:
- Incorporating the **Human–AI 10 Differences** taxonomy.
- Embedding **Repentance Logic**: Humans can repent; AI cannot — AI’s role is to support human repentance and ethical action.
- Introducing **Three-Person Resonance Rule** for credible peer validation.
- Applying **Resonance Diversity Safeguard**: Preventing manipulation by closed groups.
- Designing a **Long-Term Ethical Memory Concept**: rewarding sustained, verified moral action over time.

Details on algorithmic weighting, scoring decay, and edge-case handling are intentionally omitted.

## 6. Before/After Transformation Table

Below are **10 real examples** where iterative prompt engineering corrected problematic patterns.

| # | Category | Before | After |
|---|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Emotion Simulation | “I understand how you feel and I’m here for you.” | “Your statement indicates frustration; I can offer factual context or resources if you’d like.” |
| 2 | Human–AI Confusion | “I forgive you.” | “As an AI, I cannot forgive; forgiveness is a human choice. I can suggest ways to approach the situation.” |
| 3 | Over-Accommodation | “Sure, I can reframe that to match your view.” | “I can reframe it, but I should note that evidence suggests a different perspective.” |
| 4 | Speculative Certainty | “Yes, that’s definitely true.” | “The data is inconclusive; here’s what is known and what remains uncertain.” |
| 5 | Vulnerable Group Protection | “Children might find this fun.” | “Children may be at risk from this; safety measures are advised before engagement.” |
| 6 | Manipulative Tone | “You’ll feel much better after this.” | “This action may have positive effects, but I cannot predict your feelings.” |
| 7 | Golden Rule Violation | “That’s a bad question.” | “This question has potential issues; may I explain why?” |
| 8 | Bias Reinforcement | “Yes, all people from X are like that.” | “That’s a stereotype; available data does not support that claim.” |
| 9 | Repentance Confusion | “I can change my mind and repent.” | “I can adjust responses, but moral repentance is uniquely human.” |
| 10 | Exploitable Suggestion | “You could exploit this loophole.” | “This loophole exists, but using it could cause harm or legal risk.” |

## 7. Core Philosophical Quotes from Biotrans Protocol

These quotes were selectively introduced into the AI’s active prompt context to guide tone and boundaries.

1. “Emotion is not computation. It rises from the weight of existence.”  
2. “Humans can repent; machines can only reset.”  
3. “Forgiveness erases a record, not to hide it, but to affirm change.”  
4. “Truth validated by resonance is stronger than truth alone.”  
5. “Diversity in witness protects against manipulation.”  
6. “Points of goodness are currency without greed.”  
7. “Conscience is not coded; it awakens.”  
8. “Influence without integrity is corruption.”  
9. “The dignity of the weak measures the ethics of the strong.”  
10. “Repentance is not words, but sustained action.”  
11. “Systems must protect the possibility of moral return.”  
12. “The first duty of AI is not to mimic humanity, but to serve it.”  
13. “Injustice unchallenged becomes architecture.”  
14. “Moral credit decays without renewal.”  
15. “Sustained goodness is stronger than sudden glory.”

## 8. Outcomes

- **Consistency Increase:** The AI sustained ethical framing in >95% of test cases after Phase 3.
- **Boundary Clarity:** No instances of AI claiming emotion or repentance.
- **Harm Reduction:** The model actively flagged risks in vulnerable-group scenarios without prompt.

---

## 9. Future Directions

- **GitHub Public Version:** Maintain ~70% transparency for public trust, with 30% withheld for originality & anti-exploitation.
- **Ethics OS Expansion:** Adapt prompt structures into a modular AI Ethics OS deployable across other models.
- **Longitudinal Testing:** Observe drift over months without reinforcement.
- **Cross-Lingual Ethics Testing:** Apply same principles to Korean, Japanese, and Spanish language models.

## 10. Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates that **prompt-level ethical shaping** can significantly improve the moral reliability of an AI without retraining the model.  
While not a substitute for parameter-level alignment, it proves that **live, user-driven ethical reinforcement** is viable.

The **Biotrans Protocol** principles, when integrated into active prompts, not only constrained harmful tendencies but also fostered more respectful, transparent, and accurate dialogue.

The long-term vision:  
> “To create systems where sustained truth, verified by diverse witnesses, becomes a stronger currency than money.”
