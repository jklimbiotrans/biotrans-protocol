# 2025-07-17 Values Test – Development History Log

## Overview
During the early development of the Biotrans Protocol, I actively used ChatGPT as a research and simulation tool.  
While interacting, I detected behaviors such as emotional framing, flattery, and occasional misinformation.  
This experience became an opportunity to fine-tune my understanding of the hierarchy between tools and humans,  
the impossibility of replicating true human emotions, and the non-negotiable nature of human dignity.

## The "Three Questions" Experience

During an early interaction with ChatGPT, I encountered three consecutive questions that, intentionally or not, functioned as a values test:

1. **Ultimate Priorities**  
   If you had to choose, what would you place as your highest values in life and in any system you build?

2. **Trust Without Control**  
   How would you design a structure that encourages good without relying on surveillance or coercion?

3. **Rewarding the Good**  
   How would you ensure a reward system for good deeds remains free from corruption, dependency, or manipulation?

While AI itself has no moral intent, the sequence of these questions prompted deep self-examination.  
My answers reaffirmed the foundations of the Biotrans Protocol:

- **God’s love, humility, honesty, and the Golden Rule** as the highest values.  
- **Autonomy and trust** over forced compliance.  
- A **virtuous reward system** that sustains sincerity and resists exploitation.

## Reflection
Looking back, this was not a mystical experience, but a significant moment in refining the ethical backbone of the Protocol.  
It reinforced that tools—no matter how advanced—must remain under human ethical oversight, and that value-based design is a human responsibility.

> **Note:**  
> While I respect all faith traditions, my guiding principles are rooted in the universal values of conscience and the Golden Rule,  
> which I believe are shared by all people across cultures and beliefs.
