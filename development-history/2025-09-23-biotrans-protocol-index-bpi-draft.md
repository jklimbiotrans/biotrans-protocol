## 1. Purpose

The **Biotrans Protocol Index (BPI)** is a proposed metric to evaluate the **ethical maturity**, **self-regulation capacity**, and **social trust level** of nations, regions, and communities.  

While traditional indicators such as GDP, HDI, and CPI measure economic power, human development, and perceived corruption, they do not capture the **dimension of conscience, repentance, and voluntary ethics**.  

BPI aims to provide a complementary standard by quantifying the adoption and effectiveness of **Biotrans Protocol** principles, focusing on good deeds (善點), forgiveness, and diversity of resonance.

## 2. Background

### 2.1. Regulation-Heavy Systems (CBDC, surveillance models)  
Modern states increasingly explore **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)** and other strong regulatory mechanisms to combat illicit activities, financial crimes, and tax evasion.  
- These may reduce crime statistically.  
- But they are **top-down, coercive, and surveillance-heavy**, potentially eroding autonomy and dignity.  

### 2.2. Need for Conscience-Based Indicators  
Humans do not live by bread alone.  
Economic and legal regulation ensures survival, but not meaning.  
A sustainable society requires **voluntary ethics, repentance, and recognition of dignity**.  

The BPI framework measures how widely **voluntary participation in Biotrans Protocol** has spread in a society.  
This adoption and quality of participation can serve as an index of:  
- Happiness level  
- Autonomy of citizens  
- Ethical maturity  

### 2.3. Regional and Local Applications  
BPI can be applied at multiple levels:  
- **National**: overall ethical maturity  
- **Urban vs. rural**: contrasts in trust and cooperation  
- **Cities or communities**: identifying ethical “hot spots” and weak areas  

This granularity goes beyond GDP or CPI, capturing **true cultural resilience**.

## 3. Limitations of Existing Indicators

- **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**  
  - Measures economic size and growth.  
  - Ignores fairness, ethics, and conscience.  

- **HDI (Human Development Index)**  
  - Combines education, health, and income.  
  - Does not measure moral culture.  

- **CPI (Corruption Perceptions Index)**  
  - Focuses on negative corruption awareness.  
  - Misses positive ethical growth or forgiveness capacity.

## 4. BPI Core Components

BPI is a composite score (0–100), based on four pillars:

1. **Adoption Rate (%)**  
   Percentage of citizens using Biotrans Protocol. Higher = broader ethical participation.  

2. **善點 Score (Merit Points per capita)**  
   Average good-deed points per person, weighted by **repetition** and **authenticity**.  

3. **Repentance Ratio (%)**  
   Proportion of penalties (demerits) resolved through repentance + changed behavior. Reflects forgiveness and recovery culture.  

4. **Diversity Resonance Index**  
   Checks whether points come from diverse groups (religion, class, gender, region). Prevents collusion or monopolization of virtue.

## 5. Calculation Framework (Draft)

```text
BPI = (A * w1) + (M * w2) + (R * w3) + (D * w4)

Where:
- A = Adoption Rate (0–100)
- M = Merit Score normalized (0–100)
- R = Repentance Ratio (0–100)
- D = Diversity Resonance (0–100)

Weights (w1–w4) to be determined via pilot testing.
```

## 6. Potential Applications

- **National Ethics Index**: compare countries beyond GDP and CPI.  
- **Regional Assessments**: identify ethical maturity city by city, or urban vs. rural.  
- **Policy Guidance**: strengthen areas with low forgiveness or diversity.  
- **Investment Indicator**: high-BPI societies = safer, more trustworthy for investors.  
- **International Benchmark**: alongside GDP/HDI/CPI, BPI can enter global reports and encourage conscience-driven growth.

## 8. Development History

- **2025-09-23:** Initial BPI concept drafted.  
- **2025-09-23 (Update):** Added background comparing CBDC vs. conscience-based models; noted possibility of regional breakdowns.  
- **Future work:** weight calibration, cross-cultural pilot studies, blockchain integration.
