## 1. Human Nature and Its Limits
- Individual human beings appear to be driven more than 70% by instincts, desires, and short-term goals.  
- Only in the remaining space do conscience, philosophy, and institutional incentives operate to enable long-term or public-oriented behavior.  

## 2. Social Order and Authority
- Given these limits, maintaining society requires an authority structure such as **leadership** or governance.  
- Authority establishes order, enforces systems, and allows individual good deeds to scale into collective benefit.  

## 3. Historical References
- Ancient empires and rulers were often used as instruments to preserve or expand social order.  
- This shows that leadership is necessary, but it does not mean leadership itself is inherently good.  

## 4. Limits of Leadership
- Leadership itself is not synonymous with goodness; power can easily become corrupt through pride or exploitation.  
- Therefore, **checks, transparency, and the possibility of repentance** are always required.  

## 5. Modern Proposals for Sustainability
- This document does not advocate blind religious faith.  
- In practical terms, the sustainability of society requires **transparent information for ordinary citizens**.  
- Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies can reduce power imbalances and enable citizens to independently verify information.  
- Through such structures, leadership power can be kept in check, and society can endure longer.  

## 6. Two Perspectives on Global Challenges
- **Nation-based political actors** are tied to election cycles and short-term interests, making it difficult for them to consistently address long-term global issues such as climate change, inequality, or AI ethics.  
- **International networks and global institutions** often lead the discourse on these issues and provide a long-term vision of sustainability.  
- Yet global networks are also distant from ordinary citizens and tend to be elite-centered.  
- The future of society can only be stabilized if **national politics and global discourse counterbalance and complement each other**.  

## 7. Climate Change Examples and Biotrans Perspective
- South Korea has experienced the longest recorded tropical nights and severe droughts in Gangneung, reflecting extreme weather events.  
- Europe also suffered one of the hottest summers in history, with France temporarily closing the Eiffel Tower due to heat.  
- Some nations have even withdrawn from climate agreements, despite the visible suffering caused by climate change.  
- There remains ongoing debate about the root causes:  
  1. Long-term natural climate cycles.  
  2. Human activity, such as greenhouse gas emissions.  
- However, **Biotrans takes a clear position**: while causes are important for science, what matters most is **addressing immediate problems for human well-being and ensuring a sustainable future**.  

## 8. Case Example: France’s Welfare Strain and Generational Tensions
- France is facing escalating public debt and welfare burdens, with growing intergenerational conflict.  
- Proposals such as cutting public holidays and freezing welfare spending have triggered backlash, as younger generations increasingly blame older cohorts for unsustainable fiscal policies.  
- Protests and strikes illustrate how **overextended welfare systems, combined with generational self-interest, can undermine long-term sustainability**.

## 9. Migrants, Refugees, and Social Cohesion
- Studies indicate that **refugees and economic migrants often differ in integration patterns**.  
- Refugees typically relocate due to safety, persecution, or humanitarian reasons, which may mean they arrive without clear economic goals or long-term plans for the host country.  
- Economic migrants, by contrast, often move with specific purposes such as employment, education, or skills-based contribution, and may therefore integrate more quickly into the labor market.  
- This distinction does not imply inferiority of one group over another; rather, it highlights how **motivation and preparedness affect integration, civic participation, and perceptions of loyalty**.

## 10. Lessons from the 20th Century and Proposals for the 21st
- In the 20th century, societies expanded basic rights to their maximum extent: universal education, welfare, strong labor rights, and large-scale social protections.  
- While these experiments brought progress, they also resulted in serious side effects:  
  - Socialist systems collapsed under inefficiency and authoritarian control.  
  - Labor unions, once defenders of the weak, often turned into privileged interest groups.  
  - Expanded rights without proportional responsibility sometimes led to ethical decay and social irresponsibility.  

### 21st Century Transition
- In the 21st century, the demand for human labor is inevitably decreasing due to AI and robotics.  
- This shift creates **massive surplus productivity**, which cannot be absorbed by traditional labor markets.  
- Therefore, the challenge is no longer *how to expand rights*, but **how to distribute surplus production rationally and maintain a sustainable social fabric**.  

### Biotrans Perspective
- Instead of repeating 20th century extremes, the future requires:  
  1. **A fair distribution system** for the surplus productivity created by AI and robotics.  
  2. **Blockchain-based transparent credit and reputation systems** that allow citizens to participate freely while ensuring accountability.  
  3. A balance between **individual freedom and collective sustainability**, preventing both authoritarian control and irresponsible excess.  

In short: **The 21st century must be about rational distribution + transparent systems, not absolute expansion of rights.**

## 11. Looking Toward 2040–2050: The Rise of an AI-Era Priesthood?
- By 2035, AI and robotics are expected not only to dominate technical fields but also to handle **basic administrative and bureaucratic tasks** once reserved for human civil servants.  
- By the 2040s–2050s, this may create a new social class: **a trusted minority of wise, conscientious humans who can meaningfully interact with AI systems**.  
- Such a class could resemble a “21st century priesthood” — not religious in nature, but **ethical mediators between advanced AI and society**, entrusted with guiding states and institutions.  
- Importantly, **eligibility for such roles must be determined by transparent, tamper-resistant systems**, not by personal networks or political favoritism.  

### Biotrans Protocol’s Role
- The **Biotrans Protocol score** should act as a **supplementary metric alongside CBDCs** (Central Bank Digital Currencies) to evaluate integrity, trustworthiness, and sustained ethical conduct.  
- The score must be designed so that **not even its originator can manipulate or influence how it is calculated**.  
- To qualify for the AI-era leadership class, individuals would need to **consistently remain in the highest tier of Biotrans scores over a long period of time**.  
- This ensures that AI-era “priesthood” members are recognized not by privilege or power, but by **proven accountability, conscience, and resilience over decades**.  

## 12. Constitutional Principles of Rights and Duties
- Even constitutions allow for the limitation of certain basic rights in exceptional cases for the preservation of society.  
- Likewise, **citizens’ rights cannot be absolute**; they must be balanced with how much responsibility individuals take for the consequences of their actions within society.  
- Therefore, power and rights should be **proportional to duties**.  
- This can be summarized as the principle: **“Power = Responsibility = Rights.”**  
- This balance is essential to simultaneously guarantee both social stability and individual freedom.

> **Summary**
> - Leadership is necessary to sustain social order.  
> - But leadership is not inherently good; transparency and checks are required.  
> - Blockchain-based transparency is an important tool for sustainability.  
> - Both global discourse and national politics have strengths and weaknesses; balance between them is essential.  
> - Climate change shows that immediate problem-solving matters more than endless debates over causes.  
> - Welfare overextension and generational imbalances, as seen in France, can undermine sustainability.  
> - Migration pathways (refugees vs labor migrants) influence integration and loyalty.  
> - The 21st century must focus on rational distribution of AI-driven surplus and transparent credit systems.  
> - By 2040–2050, a new AI-era “priesthood” may emerge, guided by Biotrans scores as a supplementary measure to CBDCs.  
> - Citizens’ rights must be proportional to their responsibilities to maintain a fair and sustainable society.
