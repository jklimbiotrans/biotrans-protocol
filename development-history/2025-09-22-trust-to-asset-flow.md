# Biotrans Protocol: Trust-to-Asset Flow

## üîó Overview
The Biotrans Protocol is designed to transform ethical actions and trust into verifiable, non-transferable digital assets (SBTs). Over time, these assets can evolve into reliable indicators of creditworthiness and collateral in the digital economy.
