# Commodification of Emotion – Early Warning Report  
*(Biotrans Protocol Development History Note)*  

## 1. Background Observation  
As of 2025, even in simple job recruitment processes,  
a noticeable shift in the way early 20s youth express emotions has emerged.  
They may smile or react on the surface, yet lack genuine emotional depth.  
Their conversations and behaviors lean more toward **formalized responses** than human warmth.

## 2. Phenomenon Definition – “Emotion = Expression = Commodity”  
- **Emotional expression** is no longer the natural output of the inner self,  
  but has become a **product** designed for compensation.  
- Smiles, kindness, and empathy are often trained skills used for job performance  
  or social advantage rather than authentic reactions.  
- This model has already been standardized in social media, customer service, and content industries,  
  and younger generations are unconsciously internalizing it.

## 3. Social Impact  
- **Collapse of Authenticity**: Trust in others’ emotions declines  
  as the gap between “appearance” and “inner reality” widens.  
- **Emotional Fatigue**: Continuous “fake emotional labor” drains inner energy.  
- **Weakened Community Bonds**: When emotions are commodified,  
  interaction shifts from genuine exchange to transactional exchange.

## 4. Biotrans Protocol Perspective  
The Biotrans Protocol Ethical OS holds **authenticity** and **autonomy** of human emotions  
as a core principle.  
In a society where emotions are traded like products,  
the moment AI or robots **simulate emotions**, the value of real human feelings is further degraded.  
In such a system, the priority is not **recording and scoring emotions**,  
but encouraging **genuine emotional expression** and **voluntary, selective sharing**.

## 5. Conclusion – Meaning of the Early Warning  
The “emotional zombification” expected to emerge around 2035  
is already observable in certain sectors of society in 2025.  
This is not merely a cultural shift but an **urgent signal for preserving humanity**.  
The Biotrans Protocol will document this historically  
and integrate it into the design of its future Emotional Authenticity Restoration OS.
