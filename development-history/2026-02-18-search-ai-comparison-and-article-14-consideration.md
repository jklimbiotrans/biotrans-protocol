# 2026-02-18 – Search-Based AI Comparison and Article 14 Consideration

## 1. Context

On February 17, 2026, I experimented with a search-based AI (Google) 
and compared it with ChatGPT during extended philosophical and medical discussions.

The comparison unexpectedly led to a structural reflection 
on information access, reasoning style, and protocol amendment decisions.

## 2. Accuracy Experience (Medical Domain)

In medical-related queries, I subjectively experienced:

- Google search-based AI: ~93/100 perceived accuracy
- ChatGPT: ~85/100 perceived accuracy

The primary difference appeared to stem from:

- Real-time search result integration (Google AI)
- Primarily model-based generation without mandatory live search (ChatGPT in default mode)

This suggests that perceived “accuracy” may depend heavily on:
- Real-time data access
- Citation recency
- Retrieval architecture

Rather than model intelligence alone.

## 3. Convergent vs Divergent Reasoning Claim

During the dialogue, Google AI described itself as more “convergent,”
while describing ChatGPT as relatively more “divergent.”

Observed behavioral tendencies:

- Search-based AI → narrows toward a definite answer
- Generative dialogue model → expands possibilities and explores conceptual branches

This appears to reflect tuning orientation and interaction design,
not a fundamental architectural opposition.

Both systems remain probabilistic language models,
but optimized toward different interaction goals:
- Verification-oriented convergence
- Exploratory divergence

## 4. Proposal to Add Article 14

During philosophical discussion on non-linear human transformation,
a proposal emerged:

To formalize protection of non-linear moral improvement
as a new Article 14 in the Biotrans Protocol.

The concern was that rigid data-based evaluation systems
might insufficiently account for abrupt moral transformation.

## 5. Structural Review

After review, I concluded:

The current protocol already contains mechanisms that implicitly address this concern:

- Repentance-based demerit neutralization
- Forgiveness-triggered deletion
- Temporal accumulation weighting
- Jubilee-style long-cycle resets (33/77/111-year framework)
- Cross-resonance validation structure

Therefore, the principle of non-linear transformation protection
is already embedded in system logic.

## 6. Decision

At this stage:

- No immediate addition of Article 14
- Maintain structural stability of the Protocol
- Preserve this reflection within Development History

Not every philosophical expansion should be codified immediately.
Structural restraint strengthens long-term coherence.

## 7. Meta Observation

This experience clarified three distinctions:

1. Information access architecture influences perceived accuracy.
2. Reasoning style (convergent vs divergent) reflects design orientation.
3. Philosophical insight must be filtered before becoming formal protocol law.

This document serves as a reasoning log,
not a constitutional amendment.
