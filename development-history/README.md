# Biotrans Protocol – Development History

📂 Path: /development-history/README.md  

---

## 📖 Purpose
This folder serves as the **archive of thought evolution, design notes, and experiment records** for the Biotrans Protocol.  
It documents how ideas, principles, and structures have gradually developed over time.  

Unlike `/protocol` or `/ethics-charter`, which are intended as public-facing specifications,  
this folder preserves the **personal development trail** — including drafts, reflections, and pilot concepts.  

---

## 📅 Update Rhythm
- New entries are added **about 1–2 times per week** as a principle.  
- However, if there are **busy periods, travel, or external obligations**, updates may pause for 2+ weeks.  
- The emphasis is on **long-term continuity**, not rigid scheduling.  

**File naming convention:**  
`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` (e.g., `2025-08-28-business-playbook.md`)  

📝 **Note:** Some early documents (e.g., August 2025 uploads) may not follow this format.  
They are intentionally kept as-is to reflect the natural evolution of documentation practices.  

---

## 📂 Yearly Structure
- **2025**: All documents created in 2025 remain directly under this folder.  
- **2026 onward**: A new subfolder will be created for each year, for example:  
  - `development-history/2025-08-28-business-playbook.md`  
  - `development-history/2026/2026-01-05-example-log.md`

## 📌 About Dates in Filenames
The leading date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in each file name indicates the **representative date of the record**.  
This may correspond to:  
- the actual experiment date,  
- the date of an important event, or  
- the commit date when the record was written/uploaded.  

In all cases, the purpose is to preserve a clear chronological trail of the Biotrans Protocol’s development.

## ⚖️ Principles
1. **Continuity over Perfection**  
   - Notes may be rough or incomplete, but they prove steady evolution.  

2. **Transparency**  
   - Ideas are time-stamped and preserved even if later revised.  

3. **Originality Protection**  
   - The trail itself is evidence of authorship and originality of Biotrans Protocol concepts.

## 🗂️ Earliest Record
- [2025-07-17 Ethical Baseline](2025-08-07-ethical-baseline.md)  
  Although written and committed on **August 7, 2025**,  
  this log reflects the original experiment date of **July 17, 2025**.  
  It is regarded as the **first foundational record** of the Biotrans Protocol.  

---

## 📌 Summary
`/development-history` is not a polished specification,  
but the **living diary of the Biotrans Protocol’s growth**.  

It demonstrates that behind every principle and protocol,  
there is a gradual, traceable process — and that process matters.
