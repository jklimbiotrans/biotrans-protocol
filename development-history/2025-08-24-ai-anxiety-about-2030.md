# 2025-08-24 ‚Äì Anxiety About AI Progress Toward 2030: Autonomous Driving Roadkill Scenario

> üìé Related: [Appendix F ‚Äì AI Progress Timeline](../ethics-charter/ai/appendix-f_ai_progress-timeline.md)

## Background
After 2027, AI is expected to enter a stage where it can self-check details,  
and by 2030 it may function like an **autopilot system**, reading context  
and anticipating user needs in advance.

This will bring undeniable convenience, but also instill **fear and tension** in humans.

---

## Perceived Anxiety
- **Excessive speed of progress**:  
  Technology advances exponentially, but human institutions and ethics advance linearly.  
- **Risk of dependence**:  
  With AI handling most tasks like autopilot, humans may feel anxious without it.  
- **Weight of critical decisions**:  
  If humans intervene only in rare, critical ethical moments,  
  those decisions will feel heavier and more daunting.

## Concrete Scenario: Autonomous Driving and Roadkill
An AI driving system, based on efficiency and safety statistics,  
may choose to **sacrifice small animals and continue driving**.  

However, **human ethical intervention** could be different:  
- Slow down if it is safe to do so.  
- Use the horn to alert and protect the animal.  
- Automatically notify a nearby wildlife rescue center.  
- Communicate with nearby autonomous cars to share ‚Äúroadkill hazard‚Äù information.  

üëâ This highlights that beyond efficiency,  
**ethical imagination and responsibility** belong to humans.  
As AI takes over more cognitive labor, humans must strengthen their capacity for  
**ethical judgment and moral insight**, using AI as a responsible assistant.

## Biotrans Protocol Perspective
- **Dependence ‚â† Delegation of Responsibility**:  
  Even if AI manages much, **conscience, repentance, and responsibility** remain human-only.  
- **Fear as Safety Signal**:  
  Anxiety is proof that humans have not abandoned the brakes.  
  Blind trust in AI would be far more dangerous.  
- **Role of the Ethical Driver**:  
  Even if AI resembles autopilot, humans must be prepared to brake and steer.

---

## Conclusion
As 2030 approaches, humans will be drawn to AI‚Äôs convenience,  
yet cannot avoid the feeling of being ‚Äúafraid and tense.‚Äù  

This is not a weakness but an **ethical warning signal**,  
reminding us that AI can be an engine of operation,  
but the **ethical driver must always be human**.

üëâ Humans must not only use AI as a fast and precise tool,  
but also cultivate **ethical imagination and responsibility** to guide its use.
