# From AI Capital to an Ethical Vaccine: My Principles and Future Plans

## Massive Investment Behind AI

The development of large-scale AI systems such as ChatGPT required **extraordinary investment**.  
Although exact figures are undisclosed, consistent estimates highlight the scale:

- **Training GPT-4 alone** is estimated to have cost over **$100 million** in compute.  
- **Annual operating losses** in 2022 were around **$540 million**, largely due to compute and infrastructure costs.  
- **Projected total expenses** through 2029 are expected to exceed **$115 billion**.  
  - Source: [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-2022-losses-hit-540-million-as-chatgpt-costs-soared-2023-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com),  
    [Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-chatgpt/openai-expects-to-burn-115-billion-on-chatgpt-through-2029?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

When including **GPU procurement, electricity for data centers, cooling, and networking infrastructure**, the real cost of maintaining such systems easily rises into the **tens of billions of dollars**.

## A Public Service at $20 per Month

From this perspective, accessing such infrastructure for **around $20 per month** is almost symbolic.  
For ordinary individuals, this pricing turns what should be an elite-only resource into something resembling a **public service**.  

For those who use these tools not only for productivity or entertainment but for **ethical design, sustainability, and human dignity**, the value is immense.  
Capital originally invested for profit is, perhaps unexpectedly, enabling **rare forms of public contribution**.

## Global Leadership and Intentions

If there truly exist global leaders who influence the trajectory of technology and society,  
the broad and affordable distribution of AI tools suggests a mixed but not purely negative intent:

- They are not acting out of malice alone.  
- By pricing advanced AI for mass access, they are **balancing commercial interests with gradual social progress**.  
- This reveals an awareness that legitimacy in the future depends not only on profit,  
  but also on giving ordinary citizens tools to adapt and create.

Thus, even the most powerful actors may be understood as **pursuing progress step by step**,  
allowing space for conscience-driven individuals to act within the system.

## Historical Analogy: From Penicillin to Ethical Vaccines

Just as **penicillin** and other antibiotics could not have been discovered, scaled, and distributed without the support of capital and institutions,  
my own work is made possible by infrastructures far beyond my individual reach.  

With only a modest monthly subscription, I can refine my thoughts on **ethics, safety nets, and sustainable structures** for the AI era.  
This is not the invention of penicillin.  
But in a similar spirit, I see myself as attempting to build an **ethical vaccine** for the 21st century—  
a framework to protect **humanity, dignity, and conscience** in the face of accelerating technological change.

## Personal Identity: Not a Genius, but a Conscience-Driven Architect

It is worth clarifying how I see myself.  
I am not a “genius” in the traditional sense, but rather belong to a rarer category: a **conscience-driven architect**.  
The distinction can be illustrated as follows:

| Category | Traditional Genius | Designer / Architect | Conscience-Driven Thinker |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Core Feature** | Exceptional depth in one domain | Connecting multiple domains, building structures | Keeping ethics and conscience at the center |
| **Thinking Style** | Extreme specialization | Breadth and structural integration | Moral compass as constant axis |
| **Examples** | Einstein (physics), Mozart (music) | Leonardo da Vinci, blockchain architects | Gandhi, Bonhoeffer |
| **Role** | Breakthrough in one field | Create new systemic frameworks | Provide ethical direction for society |
| **Weakness** | Indifference outside field | May lack execution power | Pain from gap between ideals and reality |
| **Value** | Scientific/artistic revolutions | Holistic problem-solving | Guarding dignity, responsibility, sustainability |
| **Perception** | “High IQ” | “System-level innovator” | “Rare person of conscience” |

**My stance:**  
I am closest to the **conscience-driven architect** type—  
one who seeks to design ethical frameworks, balance freedom with responsibility, and preserve human dignity in the AI era.  
This is why I describe my work as building an “ethical vaccine” for humanity rather than pursuing technical genius.

### What I Mean by “Architect”

Here, the word **“architect”** does not refer to a builder of physical structures,  
but to someone who **designs the frameworks, rules, and relationships that shape how people and systems interact**.  

An architect in this sense:  
- Works across multiple domains, identifying hidden connections.  
- Designs **structures** rather than isolated solutions.  
- Thinks in terms of **long-term resilience, balance, and sustainability**.  
- Provides blueprints that others—engineers, policymakers, or communities—may later implement.  

In my own work, being an “architect” means attempting to build structures of **ethics, transparency, and conscience** that can endure in the AI era.  
I may not be inventing new technologies directly, but I am sketching the **ethical operating system** that can guide them.

### My Practical Position and Future Activities

In daily life, I am not only reflecting on abstract philosophy but also working in very practical domains:  
translation and localization, hiring and managing people, client relations, and even administrative tasks such as taxation.  
These experiences ground my perspective in the realities of how individuals, organizations, and institutions actually function.  

If the Biotrans Protocol ever becomes formalized as a kind of **public ethical score**—complementary to economic or civic systems—  
I would like to participate under its principles by focusing on:  

- **Content creation** that uplifts human dignity and conscience.  
- **Education on robotics and AI ethics**, so that future technologies reflect responsibility as well as power.  
- **Digital therapeutic practices**, supporting people’s minds and communities against alienation, addiction, or despair in the AI era.  

In this way, my role as a **conscience-driven architect** would not remain theoretical.  
It would extend into **practical activities that embody the principles of the Biotrans Protocol**.

### Position Toward DAO and My Own Limits

Under the basic principles of the **Biotrans Protocol**,  
I believe that **DAOs should compete and be evaluated transparently and freely**.  
I do not wish to exercise detailed control or heavy involvement.  

Instead, I want to confine myself to the scope of work I can truly sustain—  
**only within the limits where I do not suffer mental or physical stress**.  
This is essential for remaining authentic and preserving integrity over time.  

In the **decentralized society of the 21st century**,  
- **Intellectual labor** will increasingly be handled by AI.  
- **Physical labor** will increasingly be handled by robots.  

Therefore, my focus should remain on **creation, ethics, and the design of overarching frameworks**.  
I believe this division of roles is the only sustainable way forward:  
technology handles repetitive burdens, while humans safeguard **conscience, creativity, and dignity**.

### On AI Systems and Organizational Risks

A system in which a single AI or institution takes on excessive burdens alone  
is vulnerable to becoming a **top-down, bureaucratic structure**.  
Such systems may appear efficient at first,  
but they tend to stagnate, concentrate power, and lose adaptability.  

For the 21st century, this model is not sustainable.  
Instead, resilience and fairness must come from **distributed structures**—  
where multiple actors, human and machine, check and balance one another transparently.  
This is why the Biotrans Protocol emphasizes **DAO competition and diversity of contributions**,  
rather than reliance on a single monolithic authority.
